<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The purpose of this work is twofold&mdash;to afford
a broad survey of the Latin American countries,
with the colour and interest which so strongly
characterizes this half of the New World; and to
offer in some degree a detailed study of the region
as concerns what (elsewhere) I have ventured to
term a "science of humanity" or science of corporate
life, whose main factors are topographical,
occupational or industrial, and ethical or ethical-economic.
New responsibilities are arising in our
dealings and contact with foreign lands, especially
those whose social affairs are still backward. We
must beware how we regard the folk of such lands
mainly as hewers of wood and drawers of water,
or absorbents of exported goods or producers of
dividends, or their lands as mainly reservoirs of
raw material. Elemental forces are at work in the
world to-day, which only justice and constructive
intelligence can control. The English-speaking
peoples have wide interests and consequent responsibilities
in these lands: matters which are
discussed in the final chapter.</p>

<p>As will be seen, I have embodied many descriptive
passages in this book from the various
authors of the <cite>South American Series</cite>, to which
the present work is in a measure auxiliary.</p>

<h3>A RECONNAISSANCE</h3>

<h4>AND SOME INFORMAL GEOGRAPHY</h4>


<p>Who has not felt at some time the lure of Spanish
America, the attraction of those half-mysterious
lands&mdash;Peru or Panama, Mexico or Brazil, and all
that galaxy of far-off States, with the remains of
their ancient civilization and their picturesque
modern setting&mdash;beneath the equatorial sun, beyond
the Western sea? They drew us in our youth, were
it but in the pages of Prescott, when with Cortes
and Pizarro the Aztec and Inca Empires lay before
us; they draw us even in maturer years.</p>

<p>Yonder lies the Spanish Main, glittering in the
sun as when we sailed it first&mdash;in that long-foundered
pirate craft of boyhood; there stretch
the tropic shores of wild Guiana; there the great
Andes rears its towering crests, and over golden
sands the Orinoco and the Amazon pour down
their mighty floods; whilst, in slumberous and
mysterious majesty beyond, wide as the sea of
Time, the vast Pacific echoes on its boundless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
shores. And for those, who would seek the true El
Dorado of the West the great Sixteenth Century
has not closed yet, nor ever will; the days of
ocean-chivalry are not dead, the Elizabethan
mariners come and go, for their voyages have no
end within those spacious days of history.</p>

<p>Spanish America, in fact, is enshrouded in an
atmosphere of romance and interest which time
does not easily dispel, and remains a land of
adventure and enterprise. Its sunny shores, its
picturesque folk with their still semi-mediaeval life,
despite their advancing civilization&mdash;the great untravelled
spaces, the forests, the mountains, the
rivers, the plains, and all they contain, the lure and
profit of commerce and of trafficking&mdash;all these
are matters we cannot separate from the New
World as peopled by Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, peculiarly a world of its own,
born in an impressionable period, indelibly stamped
with the strong individualism of the Iberian people
who overcame it, and it remains apart, refusing the
hegemony of the commercialistic age&mdash;a circumstance
for which we may be grateful, in a sense.
Its future is on the lap of the unknown, offering
always the unexpected: geography has everywhere
separated it from the Old World; temperament
keeps the seclusion.</p>

<p>Whatever be our errand in this new world&mdash;erroneously
termed "new," for it is old, and had
its folk, its Toltecs and pre-Incas, in the apogee
of their ancient culture developed a shipbuilding
as they did a temple-building art, they might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
come sailing around the world and found us here
in Britain still "painted savages"; whatever, I
say, be our errand there, we shall not understand
Spanish America and its people, just as they will
never understand us, the people of Anglo-Saxon
race. The gulf between us is as deep as the
Atlantic, as wide as the Pacific. The incomprehensible
Spaniard has added himself to the unfathomable
Indian, the red-brown man who sprang
from the rugged soil of America (perhaps from
some remote Mongolian ancestry), who, inscrutable
as a dweller of the moon, is still sullen and
secretive as he was and well might be&mdash;after the
rapine which followed on the white man's keel
and sail upon his shores four centuries ago; the
white conqueror, who in his adventurous greed
destroyed the Egypt and the Chaldea of America
and trampled their autochthonous civilization in
the dust.</p>

<p>And as to the Spaniards, it is their strong individualism
which presents a marked attraction here,
though one which may not generally have been
put into words: the individualism of nations
founded upon historical and geographical bases,
as has already been said. We approach here, not
a mere United States of Spanish America, not
a confederation of vast municipalities or provinces
whose borders are imaginary parallels or meridians,
but a series of independent nations, each stamped
with its own character, bearing its own indelible
and romantic name, whose frontiers are rivers and
mountain ranges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Is there any virtue in these things? In the
day when prosaic commercialism, when megalomania
and money so sway us, there is a refreshing
atmosphere about the refusal to conglomerate of
these picturesque communities, whose names fall
pleasingly on our ears. Yet there are penalties
too. Rugged and difficult of approach&mdash;the vulgar
gaze may not easily rest upon them by the mere
passport of a tourist's ticket&mdash;as are these vast
territories of forest, desert and Cordillera, Nature,
though grand and spacious, is ill at ease, and the
mood might seem to be impressed upon the
people of the land that neither is there peace for
them. For they have soaked their land with the
blood of their own sons, and we might at times
despair of self-government here.</p>

<p>But we need not despair. The malady is but
part of one that afflicts the whole world, whose
cure awaits the turning of the next page of human
evolution&mdash;a page which can be turned whenever
slothful humanity desires to do it.</p>

<p>Spanish America is really one of the most
interesting fields of travel in the world, even if it
does not make great pretension of its attractions.
From the point of view of the holiday-maker it
has remained undeveloped. The traveller who requires
luxuriance of travel, of hotel and pleasure-resort,
such as the playgrounds of Europe afford,
will not find such here, except perhaps in a few
of the more advanced cities. It is a continent
which, despite its four centuries of discovery, has
so far done little more than present its edge to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the forces&mdash;and pleasures&mdash;of modern life. Nature
is in her wildest moods: it is an unfinished world;
mankind is still plastic. The mountain trail and
the horse are more in evidence than the railway
and the motor-car; the <em>fonda</em> rather than the
hotel. Here, moreover, Don Quixote de la Mancha
has taken up his abode, and we may find him
often, to our pleasure if we like his company, as
some of us do.</p>

<p>But let us dismount. Here are beautiful cities
too. A sensitive and developing people, the
Spanish American folk would resent any aspersion
of their civilization. They have all the machinery
of culture to their hand. Here the Parisian toilette
rubs shoulders in their streets and <em>plazas</em> with the
blanketed and sandalled Indian; the man of
fashion and the man of the Stone Age walk the
same pavement. Here in these pleasing towns&mdash;some
of them marvels of beauty, some of them in
an atmosphere of perpetual spring, some miles
above the sea&mdash;are palaces of justice, art and
science. Here are republican kings and plutocrats,
rich with the product of the field and mine,
here are palms and music, homes of highly cultured
folk, speaking their soft Castilian: shops stored
with all the luxury of Europe or the United States.
Here are streets of quaint colonial architecture, and
courteous hosts and hostesses, and damsels of
startling beauty in all the elegance of the mode.</p>

<p>Here, too, are smooth-tongued lawyer statesmen,
dominating (as they always do) the
Senatorial Councils. It is true that from time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to time there are disturbing elements when rude
soldier-politicians break in upon the doctor-politicians
with the clatter of a mule-battery, on the
pavement, and the sword takes the place of the
bauble; it is true that the walls of the streets
are pitted here and there with bullet marks, from
some whiff of grapeshot, and that there are stains
of blood upon the pavements; and it is true that
against the white walls of justice, science, art and
oratory stands silhouetted the figure of the poor
Indian, or <em>peon</em>, who slinks <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">humilde</i> amid the palms
and music&mdash;doffing his hat as he passes the
Cathedral precincts&mdash;and that the veneer of civilization,
torn aside, reveals at times both the
cultured and the uncultured savage.</p>

<p>Here, too, congregate the merchants and
traffickers of all the world, Old and New, from
all the four corners of the earth to buy and sell.
Here is the Frenchman with his emporium of
finery, the Spaniard with his groceries, or the
Italian with his wares, the Arab with his little
shop, the Chinaman with his laundry (and his
peculiar affinity with the Indian, perhaps of the
same mother-race), the German with his hardware,
drugs and cheap jewellery and much besides;
the English or American with every commodity,
and in addition his mining schemes and railways
and steamers, or his municipal stocks and bonds.
For Spanish America is now a peculiarly attractive
Mecca of the international merchant and pedlar,
who does it services both good and ill.</p>

<p>Here, in this financial and business field, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Englishman has been predominant (though that
predominance may not always be, for he is closely
pressed now and must not muddle on).</p>

<p>England, indeed, soon conquered a world commercially
which she bungled in overcoming in
conquest. She early scorned Columbus, or would
not help him; at Cartagena, Callao, Rio de Janeiro,
Montevideo, Buenos Ayres, and elsewhere, her
admirals and generals seem to have failed, and
she secured but a couple of small footholds on
the continent and some rich islands off its coast.
Perhaps it was destiny; perhaps we would not
now have it otherwise, and the Spanish American
civilization develops more interestingly alone. But
interesting too would have been a British Indian
Empire in America, perhaps with possibilities and
results of value to the world.</p>

<p>But, despite all this, the British name here stands
high, and heaven grant it always may.</p>

<p>Not for all her past misdeeds, nor the present
defects arising from them, shall we forget the gifts
that Spain has made to the New World. To-day
it might indeed be said that some of the main
problems of colonial empires are but beginning
(as witness Egypt and India under British rule).
Spain made nations, even it they afterwards fell
from her by misgovernment or from natural
causes. She implanted her religion, literature,
culture, language, architecture over hundreds of
thousands of miles of forbidding desert and Cordillera,
as we shall see in these pages. Over
a zone of the earth's territory seven thousand miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
long, from the Mexican border with the United
States, throughout the twenty Republics of Central
and South America, to the tapering end of Chile,
the Spanish language is the medium of communication,
a language-area vaster than any in the
world.</p>

<p>And Portugal, the patron of great voyagers
and explorers, has left her mark and language
upon her half of the New World, the old empire
of Brazil, with a population greater than that
of all her neighbours combined. Less dominating
than the Spaniard in the long run&mdash;for
Portugal has always said of herself that she
could conquer but not colonize&mdash;Portugal has left
her own Iberian culture in Latin America.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, are the elements of life in the
making, of a civilization whose life is before it
rather than behind it; often picturesque, often
sombre, always, as we have said, a world of
its own, and possessed of its own peculiar
attractiveness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some rather serious doubts have assailed my
mind in regard to the succeeding portion of this
chapter, as to how far the weighty matters of
geography and travel-description may be treated
informally. Dare we "speak disrespectfully of
the Equator," or too lightly tread over Cancer or
Capricorn?</p>

<p>But the home-returned traveller knows that
treatment of geography and travel is generally informal&mdash;not
to say casual&mdash;especially among our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
good English folk, and at dinner, where white
shirt-fronts do gleam, and feminine elegance is
displayed, he may have to answer somewhat elemental
questions upon the whereabouts of this or
that land, region, or locality he has visited, or
upon the nature and customs of its particular
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Nor is this confined to Society chatter alone at
such pleasant moments. In the London Board
Room perhaps some stout and comfortable director
of possibly half a dozen companies whose operations
are of no meanly distributed geographical
range may ask where such and such a country
is, with most complacent ignorance of maps and
globes; perhaps, also, in a few words doing what
it was long since said we could not do, "drawing
up an indictment against a whole nation," for
doubtless weighty (financial) reasons of his own.
As to the general public, it goes on its way careless
of where places are&mdash;except that, by reason
of the Great War, it has grown accustomed to
looking at the maps so beneficially inserted in the
columns of our daily Press, and strives to hold
the balance between kilometres and miles.</p>

<p>The foregoing lack of familiarity with the round
world and they that dwell therein is especially
true of the lands of Spanish America (or Latin
America, to use that more cumbrous but more
accurate term). "Where in the world is Ecuador,
or Costa Rica, or Paraguay?" some one may
impatiently exclaim if we mention that we were
held up by quarantine in Guayaquil on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of yellow fever, or other incident of other spot.
"Where is Bolivia?" is another not infrequent
query, but generally made in ignorance of its first
and classical utterance, it is reputed, in the
anecdote relating to Lord Palmerston and the
President&mdash;many years ago&mdash;of that Republic.</p>

<p>Some think Mexico is in South America, and,
no doubt drawing their ideas from their or their
parents' study of Prescott in the Victorian age,
ask if the Mexicans really wear feathers and carry
knives. The position of Peru puzzles many good
folk, although it is generally believed to be somewhere
in South America, which of course is right.
Chile, again; where does it lie? Did not some one
once describe Chile&mdash;if you look at the map&mdash;as a
country two thousand miles long and two inches
wide? Again, striving to give an idea of the vast
length of Chile, one writer of the country has
graphically remarked that you may conceive it as
a "long, narrow trough of which one end could
be placed at Queenstown and the other near New
York, but along which luggage could not be
rolled." No offence is here meant to the enterprising
people of that land, who resisted so stoutly
the pretensions of their neighbours of Argentina
in order that this narrow width might not be pared
down still closer, a contention finally ended by
the arbitration of King Edward of Britain.</p>

<p>For both Argentina and Brazil seem to have
been bent, at one time or another, on carrying out
the principle that to him who hath not shall be
taken away even that which he hath, for both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
them sprawl&mdash;geographically that is&mdash;across the
South American Continent and crowd their smaller
neighbours into its margins or corners, if crowding
be possible here. As for Brazil, it must have
more political frontiers, one imagines, than any
other nation in the world.</p>

<p>The traveller sometimes finds it necessary to
explain that Colombia has nothing to do with
British Columbia. It is a republic quite unassociated
with our Imperial outpost of British
Columbia. As for Venezuela, only those who have
been there can ever be expected to know where it
is, notwithstanding that it is the part of South
America nearest to Europe and was that first
sighted by Columbus. The Guianas are rightly
associated by many with Demerara sugar, but
Demerara, it has to be mentioned, is not the
whole of British Guiana, and there are in addition
French and Dutch Guiana. British Guiana and
British Honduras&mdash;which latter, let us remark, is
not in South but in Central America (location to
be explained later)&mdash;are the only foothold of the
British Empire on the mainland of Spanish
America. Guiana, moreover, has nothing to do
with Guinea, in Africa, or New Guinea, in Asia.
Few people at home know where these places are
or who lives there or what they do. As to the
first-named, it is interesting to see that a deputation
has recently arrived from the colony in the
Mother Country, to remind that parent of her offspring's
existence.</p>

<p>Both these small places&mdash;they are as large as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
England&mdash;are perhaps among the most backward
portions of the Empire. It is not their fault, or
not alone. It is largely due to the stupidity or
lack of interest of the Home Government. It
is also due, in general terms, to the stupidity and
ignorance of British folk in general, who take little
interest in their possessions overseas, and who from
one point of view do not deserve to have them.
The tropical colonies of Britain, and among them
are these of South and Central America&mdash;not to
mention the magnificent heritage of the West
Indies, which of course are geographically part of
America&mdash;are most valuable charges, most essential
elements of the national food supply. They
are at least geographical larders, and it is
time they were much more fully developed
and cared for.</p>

<p>It is well to recollect, moreover, politically, that
Britain has scarcely given an efficient object-lesson
of development, social and economic, to the
backward States of Spanish America in her control
of these two Crown Colonies.</p>

<p>But we digress. If the geography of the South
American States is nebulous to the ordinary
person at home, how much more so is that of
Central America? In the first place, it may be
asked, where or what is Central America? Many
well-informed people do not know. North
America and South America are easily realizable
as geographical entities, but where can a third
America exist? Central America is not the centre
of the South American Continent, as some well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
people think, but is that part of America
lying between the two continents, and includes
no less than six independent Republics, together
with British Honduras. The Panama Canal cuts
through it; the Tehuantepec and other railways
cross it. Thus when we are asked where is Costa
Rica or Nicaragua or Salvador, Honduras or
Panama, where perhaps the latest revolution has
just broken out, or the Government have just repudiated
a loan, or managed to pay an instalment
of the interest due upon a loan, we may reply in
Central America.</p>

<p>And Paraguay&mdash;ah, Paraguay! Where is it?
And Hayti, too?</p>

<p>Many people in England have relatives in
Spanish American countries, and it is interesting
to be able to inform them where the particular
localities are situated, and how to get there, also
the distances approximately places are apart. "I
have a cousin who is Chargé d'Affaires in
Revolutia," says a lady at a reception. "I do
trust he has not been injured by that terrible South
American earthquake we saw in the paper this
morning." We are able to assure the lady that
the earthquake was in San Volcania, at least two
thousand miles from the enterprising Republic
where her relative carried on his doubtless invaluable
diplomatic duties. "Have you ever been
in &mdash;&mdash; (we will call it Santa Andina)?" says a
stout, bald-headed gentleman, who looks like a
company promoter (and we afterwards found that
he was such), referring to a well-known Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
American capital, adding that he thought of going
there, and had heard that no great difficulties
attended the journey. He thought oil concessions
were to be obtained there. When he learned that
you take a river steamer, then a train, then a
canoe, then a steamer again, and lastly a mule,
his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wanderlust</i> seemed somewhat to abate. The
story of the lady who had a relative in New York,
and hoped he would call one morning on the
brother of another person present who lived in
Buenos Ayres has often been told, but I am inclined
to regard it as far-fetched. The point is
that the lady, knowing that both places were in
America, imagined they must be in easy daily
radius of each other.</p>

<p>The traveller who knows Spanish America and
speaks the Spanish language&mdash;which language is
a veritable delight when you know it&mdash;will often
wish that English people would set out to acquire
at least a slight knowledge of the pronunciation
of Spanish words and place-names. He does not
like to hear, for example, Buenos Ayres spoken of
as "Boners' Airs," or Callao as "Cally-oh"! And
the pronunciation of señor as "seenyor" is most
offensive. Again, why will the English Press persist
in depriving "señor" and the Spanish letter
"ñ" generally of its ~, or in using Don where
Señor should be used (as is done even in <cite>The
Times</cite>), or in the rendering of the Spanish (or its
Italian or French equivalent) <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva!</i> as "long
live." It does not mean "long live," but "live"
or "may he live," and is generally followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">que viva!</i> "Let him live." It would be better
translated as "Hurrah for So-and-So." However,
the Press does not generally treat Spanish America
very seriously. There is an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opéra bouffe</i> element.</p>

<p>The Spanish language is perhaps the most
beautiful and pleasing in the world, when we take
into account its virility and brevity. It says what
it means at once, and every letter, except the
aspirate, in every word is pronounced. It is a
simple language, easily learned. It is spoken over
an enormous part of the earth's surface, and there
is little variation between the Spanish of Castile
and that of Spanish America.</p>

<p>When we converse&mdash;in their own language&mdash;with
the educated Spanish American folk, we find
them full of wise saws and modern instances.
They are shrewd and philosophical, and the Spanish
language abounds with proverbs and aphorisms
applicable to the things of everyday life. They
are born statesmen and lawyers and orators. They
go back to the remote classics for their similes. All
this is very delightful in its way, and the Englishman,
after a course of years of it will come home
and think his own countrymen rather stupid and
unimaginative; that is if his own common sense
does not balance their own more solid qualities
against the more surface attainments. What he
wishes is that the one race might partake more of
the qualities of the other, and vice versa. Oratory
and theory cannot replace practical politics and
justice, but we miss the amenities.</p>

<p class="center">
Mucha tinta y poca justicia!
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p class="noind">so says the Spanish American (or the Spaniard),
referring to the national power of document-compiling
and red tape; that is to say: "Much ink
and little justice."</p>

<p>Nor yet can the most delightful spirit of hospitality
make amends for the insufferable defects of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fonda</i> and the inn, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">De tu casa a la ajena<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sal con la barriga llena!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">is the soundest advice in Latin America to the
traveller in the interior, or, as one would say,
"From your own to a stranger's home, go forth
with a well-filled belly."</p>

<p>The Spanish American people, as we have
remarked, are of a poetical and sentimental
temperament, given to oratory, and they produce
many poets, many of which, however, would, if
criticism is harsh, be termed versifiers. They are
fond of what might be termed descriptive embroidery;
what, indeed, one of their own race has
termed <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">desarollos lyricos</i> ("lyric developments").
Love verses are an absorbing theme, and their
small magazines overflow therewith, and even the
daily Press does not disdain such. It might be
said that versifying in Spanish in matters amorous
may be facile, because <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amores</i> (love), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flores</i>
(flowers), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olores</i> (perfume), and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">dolores</i> (grief) all
rhyme! One cynical Spanish American poet, however,
has propounded the following, descriptive of
the social and natural ambient:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flores sin olor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hombres sin honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mujeres sin pudor!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">That is to say: "Flowers without perfume, men
without honour, women without modesty." It is
true that the flowers in the New World here sometimes
lacks perfume, where we might have expected
to find such, and that at times men and women
lack the cardinal virtues, but the same could be
said anywhere, and is merely an epigram.</p>

<p>The verse-making of the young poets is often
erotic and neurotic, addressed to the object of
undying affection, or to the shades of night, or the
cruelty of destiny&mdash;which tears lovers apart or
carries them off to early graves. In this connexion
Byron is well regarded (but let us say nothing derogatory
of Byron) and Shakespeare appreciated.</p>

<p>However, it is to be recollected that these are
rather symptoms of youth in a nation, and if the
more blasé and practical Briton&mdash;and the still more
practical and less poetical North American&mdash;finds
their verse hackneyed (if he be able to read it,
which is not frequently the case), this sentiment has
its valuable psychical attribute. The English,
indeed, are regarded by the Spanish American as
of a romantic temperament, or of having a reputation
for romance, and this is possibly due in part
to Byron.</p>

<p>But let it not be forgotten that there are famous
Latin American poets, to which space here forbids
even the barest justice to be done.</p>

<p>The Spanish Americans are great panegyrists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
moreover. The most extraordinary adulations of
public personages are made and published, such as
it might be supposed would cause the object thereof
to blush. The late President Diaz of Mexico was
always to his admirers&mdash;or those who hoped to
gain something by his adulation, and this it is not
necessarily unkind to say is often the motive of the
panegyric&mdash;a "great star in a Pleiades or constellation
of the first magnitude," and similar matters
are found in all the republics. A stroke of ordinary
policy becomes thus "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">un acto de importancia transcendental</i>,"
which sufficiently translates itself; and
so forth.</p>

<p>Of course, it is the case that the Spanish
language lends itself peculiarly to "lyric developments";
it is expressive and sonorous, and even
the uneducated person has in it a far wider range
of thought and expression than has the apparently
unimaginative and tongue-tied Briton, or American
of Anglo-Saxon speech. Upon this theme we
might greatly enlarge, but we must refrain.</p>

<p>As I have already remarked, the general conception
of the Spanish American people by English
folk is a vague one. To such questions or
remarks as: "Are they mostly Indians?" or "I
suppose they are not mainly niggers, or at least
half black?" in brief terms, the reply is that
the Spanish American people are a blend of
the aboriginal Indian race&mdash;which possessed an
early civilization of its own in certain districts, as
in Mexico and Peru, and has many valuable
qualities&mdash;and of the Spaniard, or in Brazil of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Portuguese. They are not "half-breeds" now.
We might as well, in a sense, call the English
half-breeds, because we are a mixture of Celt and
Saxon and Norman.</p>

<p>The "Indians" of Mexico and Peru&mdash;they are,
of course, not Indian at all in reality, that was an
error of Columbus&mdash;had, before the Spaniards
destroyed it, a fine culture of their own and practised
the most beautiful arts. As to the modern
culture, or that of the upper strata, it surprises
good cultured English folk to learn that in
matters of serious culture, knowledge and social
etiquette, and knowledge of the world, they themselves
would have difficulty in holding their own.
The world, or outlook, of the educated man or
woman of Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, or any other of these States, is a
wider one than that of the British middle-class
folk: that great respectable body of persons so
closely engaged upon their own affairs.</p>

<p>Some writers have deplored the separate
autonomy or absence of "unification" of the
Latin American States. They would like to see
a "United States of South America" or a Federation
of Central America.</p>

<p>But this largely arises, perhaps, from the peculiar
ideas of hegemony which the last and present
century brought to being. We were to have vast
empires. Weaker nations were to be controlled
by stronger. There were to be great commercial
units. Is this advisable, or will it be possible?
The condition of the world after the Great War<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
would seem to indicate the negative. It would
seem to show that small nations have their own
destiny to work out.</p>

<p>As regards Spanish America, its different States
are, in general, better in being separated. Both
geographical conditions and those of temperament
support this. These States, or their capitals and
centres of population, are generally divided by
Nature from each other, often by tremendous barriers
of mountain chains, rivers or impenetrable
forests. How could a single or centralized government
be set up to control either their home or
foreign policy? Where would it be, and how
would it operate?</p>

<p>It might be said that similar topographical conditions
obtain in the case of the United States,
Canada, or Australia, which prefer to live as
federations. But the natural geographical barriers
of Spanish America are, in reality, much more
formidable. Again, the present multiplicity of
states, each with its complement of president and
state officers, gives opportunity for more intensive
political training, more pleasing social life and a
greater general opportunity for partaking in
government by the people than does a centralized
government.</p>

<p>Let us thus refrain from judging too hastily or
too harshly the Spanish American people. Their
temperament, their environment is different from
ours. They have not chosen or been able to follow
the more prosaic, more useful life of England or
North America in the commercial age. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
had not our inventive, our mechanical gifts. Under
their warmer skies idealism played a stronger part.
They could not agree to live together unless idealistic
conditions were to dominate them&mdash;conditions
which were impossible of course, and they never
were able to oil the wheels of life with that spirit
of compromise which providence&mdash;if it be a providential
gift&mdash;gave to us. Moreover, they have
a dreadful history of oppression behind them, and
the dead-weight of a great Indian bulk of folk
who were ruined by the arrogant Spaniards, who
despised them without a cause.</p>

<p>Rather let us see that they are endowed with
many gifts, and that a different phase of world-development
and civilization may give these people
an opportunity to display their best qualities, of
overcoming their serious errors.</p>

<p>The thoughtful traveller will find matter of
interest in Spanish America wherever he journeys,
in the delightful place-names he encounters, which
a little trouble will enable him to pronounce, and
often whose pleasing origin some study will permit
him to understand. Here are no duplications of
"Paris," "Berlin," "London"; no monstrosities
of "Copperville," "Petroleumville," "Irontown,"
and so forth, such as in Anglo America, the United
States and Canada, the developers of that part of
America in some cases hastily assigned to their
places of settlement or industry, either through lack
of or laziness of search for original topographical
nomenclature. Here in Spanish America its old
and rightful folk had given poetical baptism to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
their localities. Such were often the abiding places
of deities or spirits. Yonder mountain, for
example, was "the home of the wind god" of the
Quechuas; yonder point the "place of the meeting
of the waters" of the Aztecs, or the "field of the
fruitful," or the "forest of the dark spirits"; and
thus is imprinted upon them for all time the poetic
fancy of their founders. There rises the "snow-forehead"
of the Andes, there is the "cañyon of
a thousand ripples," there is the "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pompa</i> of the
Holy Saints." The names flow liquidly from the
lips of the Indian, perhaps our harsher tongues can
ill articulate them in comparison.</p>

<p>Moreover, let us remark the wealth of topographical
nomenclature, both in the native
languages of Mexico and Peru, and all the sisterhood
of states, and in the later Spanish tongue.
Every hill, hill-slope, stream, wood, plain, valley,
desert, every kind of hill, feature and topographical
change of form is designated.</p>

<p>The present chapter, it is seen, is, in some small
degree, designed to prime the intending traveller
to Spanish America&mdash;or, if not the traveller, the
person athirst for information concerning the
region&mdash;with such geographical detail as he or she
may assimilate without mental indigestion. In
accordance with this purpose we may consider a
few figures, which are indispensable if we are to
gather any intelligent idea of extent and distance.</p>

<p>There are twenty independent republics of
Spanish, or rather Latin America, ranging from
the enormous Brazil, with an area of three and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a quarter million square miles, down to little
Salvador, with only seven thousand two hundred
and twenty-five square miles. Among these twenty
States we include Hayti and Santo Domingo, places
which, although often mentioned with a smile when
independent republics are spoken of, are nevertheless
worthy of geographical respect.</p>

<p>Between these great extremes of area mentioned
above we have such countries as Argentina, with
over a million square miles, and Mexico, Bolivia
and Peru, with from nearly to over seven hundred
thousand square miles, Colombia, Venezuela and
Chile, with from over four to under three hundred
thousand, Ecuador and Uruguay with half
and a third those areas, and the remaining nine
States of from about seventy thousand square miles
down to about a tenth thereof.</p>

<p>The total area thus covered of this very diversified
part of the earth's surface is about eight and a
quarter million square miles, with a total population
in the neighbourhood of eighty million souls.</p>

<p>It is of interest further to recollect that Brazil is
larger than the United States or Canada, or larger
than Europe without Russia. Even the little but
progressive country of Uruguay, crowded by Brazil
and Argentina into a corner of the Atlantic coast,
is much larger than England.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>It is to be recollected that the areas given to
these countries themselves in some cases include
territory claimed by their immediate neighbours,
for there are unsettled boundaries and frontiers,
especially in the Amazon Valley. They must be
regarded as only approximate.</p>

<p>The same remark holds good with regard to
the population of these States. Exact enumeration
is impossible, for the reasons both that the inhabitants
are often enormously scattered over vast territories
and that they often refuse to be numbered,
or escape the census, fearing that they are to be
taxed, or pressed into military service against their
will, which latter condition has been a curse of
Spanish America all through its history.</p>

<p>Much of our earlier knowledge of Northern
South America and Mexico was due to Humboldt,
the famous German savant and traveller. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
born in Berlin in 1769, but it would appear that
Berlin was certainly not his "spiritual home."
Paris was the only centre congenial to him, and
he settled there in 1808, after his travels, in order
to be able to secure the needful scientific co-operation
for the publication of the results of his work.
"The French capital he had long regarded as his
true home. There he found not only scientific
sympathy, but the social stimulus which his
vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He
was equally in his element as the lion of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">salons</i>
and as the savant of the institute and the observatory.
The provincialism of his native city was
odious to him. He never ceased to rail against the
bigotry without religion, aestheticism without culture,
and philosophy without common sense, which
he found dominant on the banks of the Spree.
He sought relief from this 'nebulous atmosphere'

<p>It was by an accident that Humboldt directed
his steps to Spanish America, for he had hoped,
with Bonpland, to join Bonaparte in Egypt, but
in Madrid he determined to make Spanish America
the scene of his explorations. He explored the
Orinoco, crossed the frozen Cordillera to Quito,
investigated the mighty avenue of the Ecuadorian
volcanoes&mdash;the farm he occupied still exists at their
foot&mdash;and did much else in South America and in
Mexico, geological, archæological, and botanical.</p>

<p>The foregoing glimpse of Berlin which Humboldt's
view of his native city affords is not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
interest to-day, when the savagery of the German
character&mdash;a curious development of that earlier
obscure philosophy&mdash;has been brought so prominently
before the world and has brought Germany
to moral ruin, and what is in part financial ruin
and the loss of her colonies.</p>

<p>As has been said, methods of travel here are
less inviting to the ordinary tourist than the well-prepared
fields of the Old World. Its hotels&mdash;apart,
perhaps, from a few here and there&mdash;are primitive,
its railways are conducted for commercial purposes,
there are no planned centres of delight and ease.
No roads traverse the countryside whereon the
motor-tourist may spend his hours. Between
the primitive mule-trail or the bypath which the
simple Indian has found sufficient for his purposes
since the world began, and the railway, there is
no <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">via media</i>. The coaching days of England
never had their counterpart in Spanish America.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</i>, the horseman-gentleman, transplanted
from old Spain, and all he represented
embodied, and still embodies, the philosophy of
the road. Here no one may walk the countryside,
except the necessitous Indian. The dust would
smother him, the naked rocks would cut his feet,
he would lose caste for being on foot. No
"local" botanist, antiquarian, nature-lover sallies
forth from Spanish-American villages. The
country squire is unknown, the landed estate is a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hacienda</i>, a hive of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peones</i>, dependent body and
soul on the will of their masters. There are no
week-end cottages; the "picnic," though its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
English name is not unknown, is a rare event.
Sport, where it exists, is an institution engrafted
from abroad.</p>

<p>Woman here is much enclosed in the seclusion
of her home, save when she ventures to the
temple and the priestly Mass, or to well-chaperoned
and formal events&mdash;she dare not traverse the road
alone, and, it may be said, with sufficient reason!
The Spanish American youth, with his patent
leather shoes and breadth of cuff and collar, loves
not to leave the easy pavements of his towns, or
their bars and cafés, for the unknown world beyond,
whose beginning is the squalid Indian quarter
which fringes the place around&mdash;unless indeed he
may have turned revolutionist, a phase which does
not usually take place much before middle age,
when the Latin American generally takes on his
serious political habit. Then indeed he must take
to the road, unless a fortunate <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">golpe de estado</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
shall complete the uprising within the city plaza.</p>

<p>The inland method of travel is the horse or
mule: the saddle. Unfortunately the horse is not
very happy here. In the Day of Judgment, if
the beasts of the field ever bear witness against
man, the horse will have a severe indictment to
bring against the Spanish American people. He
and his relative the mule have nowhere perhaps
been so dreadfully ill-treated as in these lands of
mountains and deserts. In Mexico we see him
ridden to death by the callous vaquero; his thin
and starving body passing like a swift shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
across the wilderness under the stimulus of enormous
spurs. Or he is gored to death in the bull-ring.
In South America he climbs, with enormous
loads, the dizzy ridges of the Andes, under the
blows and curses of the arriero, and, stumbling
over the precipice, finds rest at times a thousand
feet below, where his mummified carcass remains
a warning to his kind. Or he passes his life on
high uplands where pasture is unknown: his fodder
a little dry straw.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Spanish American lands,
in great part, did not seem fitted by nature for
the equine race, and there was no horse in America
before the Europeans introduced the animal there.
There was nothing but the llama, the friend of the
Indian, which is not ridden, but bears a small
burden. The Indian himself at first displayed
great terror of the horse (especially with an
armoured Iberian on its back). He himself was
accustomed to carrying his burdens. When he
was told to take a horse he said: "No, horses get
tired; we do not." When a Spaniard rode across
the Isthmus of Panama upon a jackass he met
some Indians, and the animal brayed, and the
Indians fell down in terror and offered up their
gold ornaments!</p>

<p>Yet the Latin Americans are perhaps the most
expert of horsemen, and train and manage their
steeds as no one else can.</p>

<p>Spanish America is not a land for the huntsman,
not a land of big game. Its zoology is stinted.
The lion and the tiger are represented only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
some almost insignificant felines, and the other
huge quadrupeds of the sportsman's rifle came not
to being in the New World, or deserted it by now
fallen land bridges before their skilled tormentor
appeared upon the earth. There is, relatively, but
little game, and the traveller who might think to
subsist upon it in his passage through the wilds
will do well to ponder the experience of the early
Conquistadores, some of which have been set down
briefly in these pages.</p>

<p>Thus far the picture of travel here. There are
phases on the other side to be considered. It is
the explorer, the pioneer, who will find material
for his desires in these lands. The geographer,
the antiquarian, the naturalist, the ethnologist has
before him a field which is the equal of any region,
and the engineer, that most practical and valuable
of travellers, has work before him in this score of
independent states whose magnitude has, so far,
no limit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>A HISTORICAL OUTLINE</h3>


<p>It would be manifestly impossible, in the present
work, to enter in detail upon the wide field of the
history of the Spanish American States. Yet, just
as in order to gain an intelligent idea topographically
of the region we must refer to its
main geographical features and disposition, so must
we cast a glance at its historical outlines. Those
readers who are drawn on to fill in the detail have
ample material at hand in the books recently published
on the Latin American States.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The beginnings of history and of geography are,
of course, inextricably interwoven, and in the case
of America this is markedly so. America, in a
sense, was discovered by accident, and its first discoverers
did not know they had brought to being
a new continent. Columbus, to his dying day,
believed it was India he had reached, which he
had set out to reach, and would not be persuaded
to the contrary.</p>

<p>On the maps of the earlier geographers there
was, in fact, no room for America. From the
shores of Europe and Africa to those of Cathay&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
old, mediaeval, and still the poetical name for
China, the great Asiatic coast&mdash;stretched one sea,
the Western Ocean, broken by some small islands
and Cipango, or Japan. Scholars and dreamers,
studying isolated passages in cryptic and classic
writings, or arguing from general principles, in
which the wish was at times father to the thought,
believed that by sailing west India could be
reached.</p>

<p>These dreams of poets and the beliefs of
scholars crystallized in the mind of the Genoese
sailor, Columbus, a man of humble origin, and
after many disappointments and disillusions, in the
interviewing of kings and high personages for aid
and patronage (among them the King of England,
but England with characteristic lack of imagination
would have none of it, and the King of Portugal,
who tried to cheat him), was enabled to set sail by
aid of the Queen of Spain&mdash;women having more
imagination than men&mdash;in three small vessels, and
made his great and memorable landfall in the New
World on October 12, 1492, in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>These islands Columbus and his officers believed
to be those described by Marco Polo, as forming
the eastern end of Asia; and thus arose the name
of "Las Indias," the Indies, which America long
retained.</p>

<p>As a result of this discovery, a controversy arose
between Spain and Portugal, for, in 1454, the
Pope had given the Portuguese&mdash;by what right
he himself doubtless best knew&mdash;exclusive control
of exploration and conquest on the road to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Indies, although his Bull had in view only the
eastern route. Now, however, "spheres of
influence" might easily clash. The two Powers
repaired again to the Pope, successor of the former,
and he, drawing a line across the map of the world
from north to south, in a position west of the
Azores a hundred leagues, awarded Spain everything
that might lie beyond it. The Pope was
a Spaniard. The Portuguese did not think the
award fair. (It might have been mentioned that
the Portuguese King, his "especial friend," had
treacherously endeavoured to forestall Columbus
by dispatching a caravel on his proposed route
secretly, instead of helping him, a futile errand,
however.) They protested, and by common consent
the line was shifted to 370 leagues west of
the Cape Verde Islands, corresponding to-day to
the 50th degree of longitude.</p>

<p>Such a line cuts South America across the
mouth of the Amazon, and the Spaniards claimed
the right to exclude all other people and all trade
but their own from beyond this line.</p>

<p>The subsequent conquest and discovery of
America embodies some of the most romantic
and stirring episodes in history. In his last voyage
Columbus explored the West Indies and reached
South America, landing at the mouth of the
Orinoco, and he sailed along the coast of the
Caribbean and Central America to Nombre de Dios&mdash;"Name
of God"&mdash;near Colon. Henry VII of
England&mdash;who had declined to help Columbus&mdash;now
kindly permitted John Cabot to sail, in 1499,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
who discovered Newfoundland and did other valuable
exploits. Hispaniola was the first Spanish
Settlement, on the Island of Hayti, and this spread
to the mainland. In 1513 Vasco Nuñez de
Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Darien and Panama
and beheld the "South Sea," as described in our
chapter upon Central America. The insistent hope
of a "strait" or passage through these lands,
giving a way to the Spice Islands of the Indies,
was now given up, and when Magellan, in 1520,
passed through the strait which bears his name,
and sailed across the Pacific, it was understood
that a vast continent and a vast ocean divided
the world from Asia here, a new world, and that
lying mainly within the sphere of influence which
the Pope had so generously assigned to Spain.</p>

<p>With regard to this obsession of Colombus that
westward lay the shortest route to India, and the
insistent idea of a strait, have not these been
materialized in the Panama Canal, and are not
these ancient mariners vindicated to-day?</p>

<p>The New World now belonged to Spain. Perhaps
the first purpose of the Spaniards was trade
with the Indies, but their main object was that of
gold, to be gained by slave labour. They could
not themselves work in the tropics, even if they
had had any desire for manual labour, which they
had not. However, they began to introduce European
plants and animals into Cuba and Hispaniola,
a service which was of enormous value later to
America, which possessed but a meagre range of
staple food products and no beasts of burden or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bovines. But gold&mdash;that was what they wanted.
The shallow deposits of the island were soon exhausted,
as were the poor willing Indians, killed
off by forced labour. The barbarous treatment of
the aborigines of the New World by the Spaniards&mdash;and
the Portuguese&mdash;is one of the most dreadful
blots on the history of America, indeed of the
world.</p>

<p>The easily gotten gold being exhausted, it was
necessary to go farther afield. The Darien Settlement
was transferred to Panama, the coasts of
Yucatan and the Gulf of Mexico were explored
by Cordova and Grijalva, from Cuba, and in 1519
the great Conquest of Mexico was entered upon
by Cortes.</p>

<p>So far the Spaniards had found little difficulty
in subduing the Indians to their will, the inoffensive
islanders, and Caribs, which latter became almost
exterminated. The Indian folk of these islands
were generally a simple and credible race, who at
first looked upon the white man as a demi-god,
but these simple children of the soil were treated
with utmost callousness and barbarity. There is
an example in the treatment of the natives of
Watling Island in the Bahamas, which, as before
remarked, was the first point in the New World
trodden by Columbus. Of this land and its folk
the explorer wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella:
"These beautiful islands excel all other lands. The
natives love their neighbours as themselves, their
faces are always smiling, their conversation is the
sweetest imaginable, and they are so gentle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
affectionate that I swear to your Highness there is
no better people in the world." But what was
the lot of these folk? The Spaniards wanted
further labour in the mines of Hispaniola, and
to get these natives there they, trading on a
characteristic love of the people for their
ancestors and departed relatives, promised to convey
them to the heavenly shores, where these were
imagined as dwelling; and so, treacherously getting
them on board the ships, they were taken
away to the mines, where it is said 40,000
perished under starvation and the lash.</p>

<p>The natives of Mexico were people of a different
stamp. The Aztecs were <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pueblo</i> or town
Indians, highly organized as soldiers, skilled in
arts and crafts, with a developed civilization and
certain intellectuality. They were highland folk,
the Mexican plateau lying at seven to eight
thousand feet above sea level, protected by
mountain fastnesses. It was, in fact, an empire
of the New World such as, in some respects, might
compare with those ancient semi-barbaric empires
of the Old World, in times more ancient. Its conquest
by Cortes was an affair of great enterprise
and toil, entailing heavy loss and suffering on the
part of the Spaniards, and at one time their defeat,
from which only a superhuman rally saved them,
at the Battle of Otumba. There was one specially
weak point about the Aztec rule. It was a hegemony,
exercised over various other Mexican races,
who hated Montezuma, the Aztec Emperor, and
his people. Cortes was skilful enough to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
advantage of this flaw in the Mexican armour, to
fan the jealousies of the subject tribes, and enlist
them to march against Tenochtitlan, the capital
of Mexico. These allied Indians, when the place
fell, themselves committed the most unheard-of
barbarities on the Aztec population, such as shocked
the Spaniards, who were unable to restrain them.</p>

<p>The Conquest of Mexico was effected by 1521,
and the success, the romance, the adventure, and
the objects of gold and silver sent by Cortes to
Spain, and the loot of the soldiers, fired the imagination
of the Spaniards in Hispaniola and Darien
to other quests. The settlers at Panama had
heard of another empire where gold was to be
had for the taking, perhaps richer and greater even
than that of the Aztecs. This was Peru, and
Francisco Pizarro and Diego Amalgro set sail from
Panama to explore and conquer that unknown
region along the sunset shores of America to the
south.</p>

<p>This adventure too was an arduous one, not by
reason of the opposition of savage natives, for the
Incas of Peru were a gentle and philosophical
people, animated by a remarkable social system,
and they offered little resistance to the white men
and the formidable men-animals, or horsemen, and
their guns. It was famine that assailed Pizarro and
his followers, and insufficient support. Also he,
like Cortes, had to contend with the jealousies and
double-dealing of the Spanish Governor of the
Indies. As for Peru, its coast was barren, as it
is to-day, and only after surmounting the dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fastness of the Andes, amid the inclement climate
of a region twelve to fifteen thousand feet above
the level of the sea, was the Inca Empire reached
and subdued. Here lay Cuzco, the Mecca of Peru,
and Cajamarca, a more northern capital. The
stores of gold recovered seem to have filled these
Spaniards' expectations, and great renown was the
result of this conquest, which was completed by
1533.</p>

<p>These exploits were followed by a period of
strife among the Spaniards, and Pizarro was murdered,
after founding Lima, the capital of Peru.
But in 1536 the regions lying between Peru and
Panama, which to-day we know as Ecuador and
Colombia, were explored and conquered, the first
by Sebastian de Benalcazar, the second by Jimenez
de Quesada. Here were dwelling other advanced
people or tribes. Quito, the capital of Ecuador,
had been the home of the Shiris, a cultured people
who were overthrown by the Incas before the
Spanish advent. The city was joined to Cuzco,
eleven hundred miles to the south, by the famous
Inca roads, one along the Cordillera, the other
along the coast. Some early Spanish historian
delighted to speak of these roads as equal to those
of the Romans, but this was an exaggeration.
Colombia was the culture-area of the Chibchas.
The Spaniards had heard of a further great empire,
a rich El Dorado, in this region, and encouraged
by the ease with which Pizarro had conquered Peru,
they made their way up the Magdalena River from
the Caribbean Sea. A pleasing land and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
gold was encountered, after severe hardships, the
people being of some considerable degree of
civilization, although not of the status of the Aztec
or the Inca. The richest plums, in fact, had fallen.
Quesada named this region New Granada, with its
capital at Bogota.</p>

<p>There still remained the conquest of the huge
territory south of Peru, known as Chile, and this,
attempted by Almagro in 1537, was carried out
by Pedro de Valdivia, who, however, was checked
by the redoubtable Araucanian Indians. These
form one of the chief admixtures of the Chileans
to-day, a hardy and enterprising nation, in contrast
with the Peruvians of a more sentimental temperament,
with a basis of the Quichua Indians of the
Incas. Terrible excesses were committed upon
the Indians on these expeditions. A terrible end
was visited upon the Spanish leader by the Indians.
"You have come for gold," said the savage chief
who captured him. "You shall have your fill."
And he caused <em>molten</em> burning gold to be poured
into his mouth. Then he was cut to pieces with
sharpened oyster shells.</p>

<p>From the Southern Andes, the Spaniards, in the
following years, descended to the great plains
which now form the republics of the River Plate,
Argentine, Uruguay and Paraguay. The exploration
of Brazil had been begun in 1510, and the
region was traversed by Orellana in his descent
of the Amazon from Quito, and it was gradually
settled by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The lands lying between Panama and Mexico,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which to-day form the Central American States,
Guatemala, Costa Rica and others, were conquered
after the fall of Mexico. Here were evidences
of a splendid past, in the beautiful temples
of sculptured stone found in their forests and
deserts, ruins even then abandoned. These
remains astounded Europe, when they were first
revealed.</p>

<p>Thus did all this enormous region of Latin
America, from tropical Mexico&mdash;indeed, from California&mdash;to
the frigid extremity of Patagonia, fall
into the possession of Spain and Portugal. In
some respects it is a dreadful history. The
Spaniards overthrew civilizations in Mexico and
Peru which in many respects were superior to their
own, civilizations that had developed marvellously
without the resources that the Old World commanded,
for there was neither ox nor horse,
nor even iron nor gunpowder. The Spaniards
destroyed everything that these people had done.
For centuries unknown they had evolved their arts
and crafts and laws; laws, in the case of the Incas
of Peru, far more beneficial and democratic than
anything Europe had produced at that period, and
millions of these people were most ruthlessly
destroyed.</p>

<p>To read the accounts of the happenings of those
times is enough to break one's heart. To-day,
throughout the length and breadth of this vast territory&mdash;of
which not an acre now belongs to Spain&mdash;the
spirit of the Indian has so far remained faithful
that there is not a single statue raised to Cortes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Pizarro. Columbus, of course, is commemorated
by his monuments in every capital.</p>

<p>These great New World territories, by virtue of
the papal Bull, were held as the peculiar property
of the Sovereign. The Spanish possessions were
divided into two "kingdoms," the Kingdom of New
Spain, consisting of Mexico and all lands to and
including Venezuela, and New Castile, later called
Peru. This last viceroyalty was found unwieldy,
and New Granada and the River Plate regions
were constituted apart under viceroys. The administrative
powers of these functionaries were very
great, but they were held in some control by the
Laws of the Indies: measures passed for native
protection. Even the frightful dominance of the
Inquisition did not extend to the Indians, who were
regarded as merely catechumens. Queen Isabella
of Spain, by whose imagination and aid discovery
of the New World had been rendered possible,
would not permit&mdash;and her memory should be
revered for it&mdash;the enslavement of the Indians, if
she could prevent it, and when Columbus returned
home with a cargo of natives, whom he proposed
to sell as slaves, Isabella interfered. Let them
be set at liberty, she said, and sent back to their
homes. Columbus has in general been represented
as a protector of the Indians, and must
not necessarily be judged in the light of this
incident.</p>

<p>In the general condemnation of Spain at that
period, these facts should be recollected. It was
declared by the home government that the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
were to enjoy the privilege of free subjects, and
that their native princes were to be upheld in their
authority. Censure was frequently visited upon the
conquerors and governors of Mexico and Peru,
from home, for their displacement or execution of
these, as any who will study Spanish colonial history
may see. Some modern writers, in their
democratic zeal, have overlooked this. The declaration
was opposed by the colonists, as well as the
colonial authorities, and indeed by the clergy.
Some compulsion was necessary, of course, if civilization
was to make its way among the Indians,
for they were often loath to work, and stood sullenly
aloof from the white race. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">System of Repartimientos
and Encomiendas</i>&mdash;the assigning of bodies
of Indians to the industrial charge of colonists&mdash;was
well meant, but the greed of the colonists
and their callous habit as regarded human life
offset these influences.</p>

<p>Another side of the question also presents itself.
Under Philip II, the colonies were governed not so
much in their own interests, as for the enrichment
of Spain and its predominance. He yearned to
injure Protestant England, and the colonists were
taxed and goaded to produce wealth, and their
interests sacrificed in the furtherance of this end.
Those into whose hands the unfortunate Indians
had been delivered body and soul, drove the unfortunates
into the mines, branded them on the face,
flogged them to death, chucked their miserable
carcasses aside, when they fell from exhaustion, a
prey to the dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>We know what these things led to. England
and other European nations refused to recognize
the exclusive control of the American continents
by the Peninsula Powers, and hardy buccaneers and
privateers streamed forth to dispute Spanish pretensions.
Drake intercepted the stream of gold
with which Philip was enabled to equip his
armadas and thus performed a marked strategic
service for England.</p>

<p>Moreover, such pretensions would never have
been respected, especially under the influence of
the Renaissance and the Reformation.</p>

<p>The restrictions upon colonial trade by Spain
were, we see further, an element in the downfall
of the empire. The natural development of South
America was seriously hindered. All trade must
come via Panama, and anything opposed to Spanish
interests was suppressed. The growing trade
between Acapulco and China was suppressed;
Hidalgo's vineyard in Mexico was destroyed by the
Spanish authorities because Spain alone must grow
grapes. "Learn to be silent and obey, and not
to discuss politics," ran the proclamation of a
Mexican viceroy, near the end of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>When&mdash;unlawfully&mdash;the throne of Spain came
to be occupied with kings having French sympathies,
these short-sighted methods were modified.
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Audiencias</i> or law courts, of which, from the reign
of Philip IV there were eleven, in Santo Domingo,
Mexico, Panama, Lima, Guatemala, Guadalajara,
Bogota, La Plata, Chile, and Buenos Ayres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
acted as counsel to the Governors, with civil
and criminal jurisdiction. Appeal could be had
to the Council of the Indies, that great colonial
body at Seville. For centuries the history of
Spanish America is made up of the deeds and
misdeeds of the viceroys.</p>

<p>The political and commercial control of the
colonies was thus entirely in the hands of the
Crown. The territories were expected to send
quantities of gold and other precious metals home
to Spain with regularity, and indeed Spain later
became a mere sieve into which this treasure from
the Indies was poured. They were also bound to
send raw material and to take all their manufactured
goods from the Mother Country.</p>

<p>It must be recollected that the ill-treatment
meted out to the natives of these lands was mainly
the work of the Spanish settlers. They generally
both despised the Indians, and wished to enrich
themselves from their labours. They were, for
the man of Iberian race, inferior creatures, to be
used at his will, and the forced labour in the
mines was a cause of the reduction of the population.
Questions have been raised by historians
as to whether the dreadful treatment of the
American native by the Spaniard was worse than
that meted out to him by the Anglo-Saxon settlers
in North America. There have been grave
abuses in the latter field. The Indians in Spanish
America, however, numbered many millions, as
against a few hundred thousand elsewhere. The
Spanish Crown and Government certainly did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
countenance the excesses carried on by the
colonists, but strove to protect the Indians.</p>

<p>As for the English colonies in America, they
enjoyed a greater measure of self-government and
had taken firm root under more prosaic but more
fruitful form. The same policy, however, on the
part of the Mother Country was enacted in commercial
matters; that trade should consist almost
exclusively of exchange of colonial raw material
for English manufactured articles. French colonies
in America were less noteworthy or prosperous,
but they played their part in history, for the fall
of French control in North America was in reality
the beginning of independence for all colonies in
the New World; as did the ideas of the French
philosophers, which found a ready soil in the
Spanish American folk. The establishment of the
United States was but the precursor to the establishment
of the numerous Latin American States.
The Spanish Government saw its danger, but was
too apathetic to move. However, some reforms
were introduced, and it may be said that Spanish
America was well governed at the time of revolution,
and was prosperous.</p>

<p>But it has been said that "across the face of all
human reform are written the words 'too late,'"
and this is in effect what happened in Spanish
America. The French Revolution, and the defeat
of British expeditions to Buenos Ayres by the
colonists in 1806 and 1807 had their effect. The
struggle for Independence lasted from 1810 to
1826, until the flag of Spain was entirely ousted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from the vast territory of Spanish America, upon
which she had stamped her individuality, language,
laws and all else, with much that was splendid
and enduring, and much that in the future development
of the world may have a value so far scarcely
apparent.</p>

<p>The dark pictures of misrule of the century of
republican life of the twenty Latin Republics are
interspersed with pages of a more pleasing nature,
but it is a chequered history, whose end we cannot
yet foresee.</p>

<p>Among elements making for disorder and bloodshed
in Spanish America, religion has played a
prominent part. Many States developed bitter
antagonism between clerical and non-clerical
parties. Some would overthrow the Church and the
all-pervading priestly power; others would uphold
it, whether out of pious conviction, whether because
it was a convenient party upon which to hang
their own pretensions and ambitions. Mexico,
Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Central America, Chile&mdash;in
fact, all have as part of their history the deadly
struggles between these factions. To-day this very
fierceness has flamed out, in the main, to be succeeded
by a thinly veiled materialism. What more
can be expected of a hemisphere which was cursed
by the Inquisition?</p>

<p>In many instances the "reform" parties of these
States having triumphed by force of arms, confiscates
all Church property&mdash;and this often was
enormous&mdash;which was handed to secular and public
purposes, or enriched the pockets of politicians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
In Mexico, where at one time it was not safe to
pass along the street unless seeming to be muttering
a prayer, the power of the Church was entirely
overthrown, and convents, monasteries and other
religious establishments were forbidden to exist.
In Ecuador similar things were brought about,
accompanied by massacre and other dreadful deeds.
But it would be unjust to pick out any state as
over-prominent in these acts.</p>

<p>The Church, in large degree, brought these
troubles upon itself. It sought for too much power,
spiritual and temporal. The priests exploited the
superstition and needs of the poor, of the Indian,
and themselves often lived immoral and corrupt
lives. But let us do it justice. It protected the
poor and oppressed often against the grinding exactions
of the civil authorities; its vicars often exposed
themselves in humane works. Often priests
dashed in with upraised crucifix to save the victims
of dreadful passionate and sanguinary revolutions,
and themselves were torn to pieces. Often the
devout fathers spent their lives in the most desolate
and savage regions of the untamed wilderness,
seeking by their piety and devotion to better the
lives of the poor Indians, the poor, ignorant
children of the mountain and the forest.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic religion ingrafted itself with
wonderful strength upon the mind of the aboriginal
of Spanish America. In some respects it seemed
a development of his own earlier superstitious culture,
and became blended with it. Tawdry images
held for them and their miserable lives the hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of eternal joy, of reprieve of sin, of comfort in
misery, and to-day we cannot enter a simple church
of the remote villages in those boundless Cordilleras
and deserts without stumbling over the prostrate
forms, bent upon the earthern floors, of poor, black-clothed
Indian women passing their silent hour in
supplication and orisons. Men are not there: the
women, as ever, seem to link the material and
the spiritual. May heaven succour these poor
Indian women-folk, and bring them a happier
destiny yet.</p>

<p>A glance now at the earlier cultures of these
lands and the earlier religions of their people.</p>

<p>Who, upon beholding the beautiful ruined
structures of the early folk of America&mdash;for by
America here we mean Spanish America, where
alone these vestiges are found&mdash;in the decaying
sculptured walls of their temples, or the massive
stories of their fortresses and palaces, or of the
strange pyramids they raised, has not felt his conception
of the New World undergo a change?
Nay, do we even study the printed page which sets
them forth, not having had the privilege of
journeying to where they stand, wrapped in the
silence of the jungle or stark upon the rocky ranges
of the hills, we feel that here is a page in the book
of mankind whose turning opens to us a vista little
dreamt of.</p>

<p>The story of those strange old cultures of Mexico
and Peru has always fascinated us: the Aztec
and the Inca stand forth from the dry lore of
archæology with a peculiar charm, which we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not have felt even in contemplating the more
wonderful and ancient cultures of the Old World.
For here we feel that the intellect and art of man
sprang unaided from the dust, to write his pathetic
story in the stones of a continent unvisited by the
Jehovah of the Israelites, unknown to history,
unblessed of Christianity, unrecorded and obscure.
Here the reaction of man from his environment
came forth from no recorded Eden; no tree of
knowledge, of good and evil, opened his eyes; no
Abraham here walked with God, no Pharaoh
or Nebuchadnezzar brought visions and dreams
to these more sombre pages, and no divine
wisdom seemed to shed its light within these
sculptured walls.</p>

<p>There is the credit due to early America, to the
ability of her autochthonous cultures, even if they
formed no permanent link in the chain of human
development, but were too early cut off and faded
away like the untimely fruit of a woman, that at
least man rose here, in accordance with the divine
mandate, arose from the dust, and if he did but
build him "fanes of fruitless prayer" to strange
idols and savage deities, he had that in common
with the majority of the cultures of the Old World
of Asia, Africa and India, where men raised
temples of the utmost beauty to shelter the most
inane rites or bloody religions.</p>

<p>Before Mitla and Palenque or Teotihuacan and
Tiahuanako let us mark the skill which carved
these intricate walls or raised their terraces and
monoliths, the greater wonder because all that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
descended from those skilled craftsmen of a bygone
age on the American soil are the stolid Indian,
incapable of squaring stone to stone, ignorant of
the bronze chisel, degenerate and fallen. The
skill and imagination which would have done
credit to the Greeks or the Chaldeans lies
buried in the dust, nor is likely yet to be
resuscitated.</p>

<p>We have spoken of Teotihuacan&mdash;the name
means in the ancient tongue of Mexico the "house
of God"&mdash;and this, the great pyramid of the sun,
the work of the shadowy Toltecs, may be seen by
the traveller to-day who, taking steamer and train,
will convey himself to the high plateau of Mexico,
a few miles north of the capital. It is a structure
of stone and rubble seven hundred feet upon its
broadest side and two hundred feet high, and,
anciently, upon its summit stood the golden image
of Tonatiuah, whose breastplate flashed back the
rays of the rising sun, what time the attendant
priests chanted their savage refrain upon the terraces
beneath. Restored by the Government of the
Republic under President Diaz, the great monument
stands up much the same as it did in days of yore.
How many centuries have beaten upon it we can
scarcely conjecture. It was in ruins when
the defeated Cortes and his Spaniards, after the
dreadful experience of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Noche Triste</i>, the
sorrowful night passed beneath its shadow and wept
thereunder for his fallen comrades and his ruined
enterprise.</p>

<p>If little we know of Teotihuacan, what shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
said of Mitla, whose mysterious halls and corridors,
scarcely defaced by time, arise from the sands
of Oaxaca.</p>

<p>And the builders of these temples, have they
produced no songs of beauty, no enduring psalms?
Had their dreadful religious rites nothing in
common with the idea of a true Providence? Hear
the psalm of Nezahual-Coyotl, the Solomon of
Mexico. This is what he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Truly the gods which I adore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The idols of stone and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They speak not nor do they feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither could they fashion the beauty of the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet that of the earth and the streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of the trees and the plants which beautify it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some powerful, hidden and unknown God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He must be the Creator of the Universe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He alone can console me in my affliction.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He alone can still the bitter anguish of this heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So spake Nezahual-Coyotl, in what has been
termed the Golden Age of Texcoco, whose historians,
arts and poets were in their time
renowned among the nations of Anahuac, on the
high Mexican Plateau. This person was a philosopher
and a poet, but the writings of the period&mdash;the
picture-writings&mdash;were perversely destroyed
by Zumarraga, the first Archbishop of Mexico after
the Conquest&mdash;an irremediable loss.</p>

<p>Hear also the Inca prayer to the Creator, as
chanted by the priests and nobles of Peru:</p>

<p>Oh Creator: Thou art without equal unto the
ends of the earth! Thou who givest life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
strength to mankind, saying, let this be a man and
let this be a woman. And as thou sayest, so thou
givest life, and vouchsafest that man shall live
in health and peace, and free from danger. Thou
who dwellest in the heights of heaven, in the
thunder and in the storm-clouds, hear us. Grant
us eternal life and have us in thy keeping.</p>

<p>This last is from the <cite>Rites and Laws of the
Incas</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is but one of many similar prayers,
which, as regards sentiment and language, might
be taken from the Bible and Church Service.</p>

<p>These prayers to the Unknown God, written by
the early people of America, cut off from any contact
with the Old World, would seem to show that
man, in the reaction from his environment, inevitably
develops within him the conception of a
supreme deity.</p>

<p>It now remains for us to choose how we shall
approach the Spanish American lands. Shall we
cross the Spanish Main, and land where Cortes did
at Vera Cruz, the city of the True Cross, and so
enter Mexico? Or shall we, still crossing the
American Mediterranean, land on the Isthmus of
Panama and thence, as Pizarro did, voyage along
the great Pacific coast to mysterious Peru? Or
shall we take steamer to the River Plate, that
more prosaic route to the lands of corn and cattle?
Or shall we go round the Horn? Perhaps the
middle course is best, and, at the isthmus, we will
first explore Central America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we may say with the poet Keats:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noind">Keats, however, was in error. It was not Cortes,
but another who gazed from the peak, as presently
we shall see.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>CENTRAL AMERICA</h3>

<h4>GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, BRITISH HONDURAS,
NICARAGUA, SALVADOR, COSTA RICA, PANAMA</h4>


<p>On Michaelmas Day, in the year 1513, a Spanish
adventurer, surrounded by his followers&mdash;they had
sailed from Hispaniola, or Santo Domingo, on an
expedition of discovery&mdash;found himself on the
high ridge of the land called Darien. His eyes,
seeking the horizon, fell, not on an endless expanse
of mountain and forest, such as here might
have been expected to stretch away into the unknown
solitudes, but upon the sheen of waters. A
smothered exclamation fell from his lips. "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El
Mar!</i>" ("the Sea!") he cried, and he and his
followers remained a space in the silence of
astonishment.</p>

<p>The Spaniard was Vasco Nuñez de Balboa. It
was one of the most dramatic of geographical
discoveries. They had but traversed an isthmus,
where they had expected a continent&mdash;to-day the
Isthmus of Panama. They had discovered an
ocean; they realized in that moment much that
before had been a mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Descending to the shore and wading deep into
the waters, Balboa drew his sword, and waving it
thereover took possession of that ocean and
whatsoever shores it might wash for the King
of Spain, naming it the "South Seas," for,
from the curvature of the isthmus, he was
looking towards the south, having crossed from
the north.</p>

<p>Thus was the great Pacific Ocean first beheld
by the white man, as far as history records.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Balboa's exploit preceded
the Conquest of Mexico. The land of the
Aztecs, like that of Peru, was undreamed of, but
the discovery of both followed, as did the passage
of the Magellan Strait by the explorer whose name
it bears, and who first crossed the Pacific, and
from its gentle and favouring gales gave it its
name.</p>

<p>The discoverer of the isthmus and the great
ocean was a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hidalgo</i>, and had been Governor of
a province, but to escape his creditors in Hispaniola&mdash;according
to one account&mdash;he concealed himself
in a barrel on board ship, and so began his voyage.
Balboa, pressing into his service a train of Indians,
many of whom, it is said, died under the lash in
the task, caused the timbers of two vessels to
be dragged across the rugged neck of land and
launched upon the South Sea, bent upon the discovery
of Peru, which, later, Andagoya attempted,
but which, however, the fates had reserved for
Pizarro. Balboa was afterwards treacherously
done to death by Pedrarias Davila, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
most ruthless of the Spanish adventurers of that
time.</p>

<p>Thus did the inhabitants of this region we are
now to traverse have their foretaste of the white
man's overlordship&mdash;a foretaste of the dreadful lot
which fate had in store for them, the simple folk
of Central America, who, with their ancient culture
and beautiful arts, akin in some respects to those
of the Aztec and the Inca, were almost stamped
out under Pedro de Alvarado, who invaded
Guatemala in 1522, and his successors of the
early Colonial period.</p>

<p>Seven different States or entities to-day comprise
this zone of territory of Central America, washed
on the one hand by the Caribbean and on the other
by the Pacific, whose people dwell in one of the
most beautiful and interesting part of the earth's
surface&mdash;Guatemala, with its coffee plantations and
lavish fruits, Honduras of the rugged surface, and
British Honduras, Nicaragua with its great lake,
Costa Rica, the one-time "Rich Coast," Salvador,
most populous and advanced of all, Panama, the
land of the famous Canal.</p>

<p>We may be permitted a brief glance at the
ancient inhabitants of this portion of America, prior
to the advent of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>As in the case of North America, in Mexico:
and South America, in Peru and Colombia, so
in Central America was there a ruling caste or
culture. Here it was that of the Quiches, a people
of Maya stock.</p>

<p>These people were most numerous in Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Guatemala, and at the time of the Conquest the
most powerful inhabitants of Central America.
The sacred book of the Quiches, known as the
<cite>Popol Vuh</cite>, embodies a mythological cosmogony,
in which is a Creation story and an account of a
Flood, after the manner of that of the Old Testament.
(The Quiches are not to be confounded
with the Quechuas of Peru.) Their capital was
Utatlan, near where stands the modern Santa Cruz
Quiche, and the place was cleverly fortified. Their
system of government was an elaborate one, as
was their religion. Indeed, the student remarks
with surprise how far these early peoples had gone
in the development of social polity and economic
order. The Quiches, like the Aztecs, kept historical
records in picture-writing. The Incas, we
may remark in passing, of Peru, kept their histories
by means of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quipos</i>, a mnemonic system of
knotted and coloured cords.</p>

<p>The Sun God was the chief deity, but there were
many lesser objects of adoration. But the religion
was of a high order in some respects, although
the Spanish priests, after the Conquest, strove to
hide the fact, and, indeed, there was wholesale
destruction throughout Spanish America of native
records and objects, whether it were of the beautiful
picture-writings and scrolls of Mexico and
Central America, whether the pillars of stone by
which the early Peruvian priests skilfully determined
the solstices. The jealous priestcraft of
the Roman Catholic religion could not tolerate
anything that showed ingenuity or knowledge by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
their pagan predecessors, and all these things they
considered, or affected to consider, "things of the
devil," and destroyed them wherever possible. The
marvel is that so much has remained, for the
benefit of the archæologist to-day.</p>

<p>The religion of the Quiches, like that of the
Mexicans, contained horrible practices involving
human sacrifices. This was probably absent in
Peru. Repulsive as it was, we may question
whether it was as cruel as the dreadful tortures
of the Inquisition, such as rendered Mexico and
Lima and other places in the New World centres
of horror, until the time of Independence, when
the infuriated populace destroyed the Inquisitional
centres.</p>

<p>We have previously remarked that Columbus
sailed along the Atlantic coast of Central America,
that of Honduras and Costa Rica, and it was here
that, seeing the ornaments of gold on the swarthy
bodies of the natives, the voyagers' imagination
was freshly aroused to the possibilities of conquest.
But the natives of this region were not necessarily
as docile as those of Hispaniola and the Antilles.
They mustered on the shore, leaping from the
dark forests as the strange sails of the Spaniards
hove in sight, communicating rapidly with each
tribe by those peculiar methods they employed,
and made the air resound with the beatings and
blasts of their war-drums and bugle-shells, brandishing
their clubs and swords of palm-wood.</p>

<p>Columbus, however, did not generally employ
harsh methods against the natives. He is regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
rather as their protector, and a beautiful monument
at Colon represents him as sheltering an Indian
who timorously looks up for protection&mdash;a contrast,
as remarked elsewhere, with the lack of
monuments in Spanish America to Cortes and
Pizarro. However, under Bartholomé Columbus,
the brother of Christopher, great animosity was
aroused on the part of the Indians in the settlement
at Veragua, resulting in the death of the
Spanish colonists.</p>

<p>One of the most tragic episodes after the Conquest
of Mexico was the expedition of Cortes to
Central America, following on the expedition he
had sent into Guatemala under Pedro de Alvarado.
There had been a desperate fight between Alvarado's
band and the redoubtable Quiches of Utatlan, and
it was only due to the fortunate circumstance of
dissension among the different predominant tribes
that the Conquest of Guatemala was so readily
carried out. Thus was history, as in Mexico and
indeed in Peru, brought about also in Central
America&mdash;fall under dissension, a house divided
against itself.</p>

<p>In Honduras Cortes committed a foul deed.
Suspecting, or pretending to suspect, Guahtemoc,
the son of Montezuma&mdash;who after the fall of
Mexico accompanied the conquerors to Central
America&mdash;of some treacherous design, Cortes had
the unfortunate young Aztec hanged head downwards
from a tree. It will be recollected that
Guahtemoc was the author of the saying, well
known in Mexico, of "Am I, think you, upon some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
bed of roses?" when, whilst the Spaniards were
roasting his feet in order to make him reveal the
whereabouts of the Aztec treasure, he replied to
his companions who were also being tortured and
were groaning in agony, and who asked if he too
suffered. This scene is depicted on a beautiful
sculptured monument in the city of Mexico&mdash;the
statue to Guahtemoc, in the Paseo de la Reforma.</p>

<p>In the early colonial government of Central
America the capital was set up by Alvarado
in the chief town of Guatemala. The scenery of
the region is striking. Great volcanoes overhang
the countryside, and these have at times wrought
terrible havoc here, and still do so. In fact, the
history of the city of Guatemala is a record of successive
destruction and re-establishment, probably
unique in the history of any land, due to the
dreadful forces of Nature, seismic, tectonic and
volcanic, exerted upon this unrestful point of the
earth's surface.</p>

<p>We may glance briefly at some of these catastrophes.
They show the trials which the inhabitants
of this part of the world are called upon
to bear.</p>

<p>The first city was established by Alvarado in
1527, on the banks of the Rio Pensativo, at the
foot of the Agua volcano, but in 1541 this unfriendly
mountain threw from its crater a deluge
of water that, carrying rocks with it, rushed down
the mountain side and bore upon the doomed city,
whose destruction was lighted by the terrible fire
which simultaneously burst from the angry peak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards the surviving inhabitants removed
their city to another site, and for twenty years
made solemn annual pilgrimages to the Ciudad
Vieja, as the former place came to be called&mdash;the
old town about a league from the new. This
flourished greatly and became the most populous
place in Central America, with more than a
hundred churches and convents, devoutly administered
after the fashion of the Catholic priesthood
and pious folk of the Spanish American lands.</p>

<p>But this progress and piety failed to give security
from acts of Nature. After being many times
threatened, this beautifully built town, in the midst
of the most romantic scenery, was destroyed by
a dreadful earthquake in 1773&mdash;earthquake to
which was added the horrors of eruption from the
volcano Fuego (or "Fire"), which overlooks it.
In vain the people confessed their sins in the open
street, in vain priests and people weepingly carried
procession of the saints and saintly relics from
church to church. The very pavements rose up
against them with the undulations of the earthquake;
the very heavens rained down showers of
stones and ashes upon them, obscuring even the
light of the volcano, and morning dawned upon a
ruined and broken city with its people crushed
beneath the walls of their own dwellings.</p>

<p>The city was moved again twenty-seven miles
away, and became the seat of government in 1779&mdash;the
third attempt, though whether it will be the
last remains to be seen, for but a short time ago
we heard of serious earthquakes in the district.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Lofty mountains rise on every side, with deep
ravines on the edge of the tablelands upon which
the city stands. The houses have been kept of
one story, as a measure of security. The general
beauty and prosperity of Guatemala city has earned
for it the name of the Paris of Central America.
We may reach it by the railway which, starting
from Puerto Barrios on the Atlantic coast, winds
upwards to the elevation of 5,000 feet, which is that
of the plateau on which it stands, 190 miles from
the sea, and continues for a further 75 miles to
San José on the Pacific.</p>

<p>Guatemala is a land rich in natural resources,
with fruitful plains and valleys, and the peculiar
volcanic constituents of the soil are specially
favourable for the production of coffee, which has
been the source of considerable wealth. There
are vast plains and extensive lakes, and innumerable
rivers and streams. Many valuable kinds of
wood exist in the forests, and such products as
cocoa, sugar-cane, tobacco, bananas, and oranges,
with other less common kinds are plentiful. There
are some small deposits of gold and other precious
and commoner metals. The climate is excellent,
except on the coast.</p>

<p>But this fruitfulness and bounty of Nature is
not conducive necessarily to peace among the
people of the land. Rather the restlessness of
Nature, as evinced by earthquake unrest, is reflected
in the politics and general economy of the
Republic. The colonial civilization, which was
marked by the destruction of the Indians and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
more or less beneficent old civilization, and the
enslavement of many tribes, with total extermination
in some cases, was succeeded by a republic
in which pretenders and dictators strove with each
other, less to advance the interests of the country
than to satisfy their own ambitions and fill their
own pockets. There were, too, constant embroilments
with the neighbouring States, and bloody
local wars. Some of the presidents, however, did
endeavour, side by side with their other activities,
to promote education and commerce, and to improve
the means of transport and communication&mdash;ever
a vital matter in Spanish America, with its
rugged soil and vast extent.</p>

<p>We find in Guatemala many remains of the
ancient folk, in beautifully carved stelæ, in innumerable
idols recovered from the soil, and in the
native arts, which, evincing the dexterity and love of
beauty of the aboriginal, have happily survived both
the destructive force of the Hispanic domination
and, so far, the equally destructive forces of modern
commercialism, which ousts their industries with
imported goods.</p>

<p>In Quetzaltenango, the ancient "Town of the
Green Feather"&mdash;the Quetzal was the sacred bird
of the Quiches&mdash;we shall specially remark the
native aptitudes in their quaint and pleasing
handicrafts. If these quiet and peaceful folk&mdash;for
the natives themselves are peaceful enough&mdash;are
from time to time disturbed by the subterranean
roarings which precede earthquake shocks in the
hills and the tidal waves upon the coast, they soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
forget these manifestations of Nature, which, after
all, are less destructive than those due to the
political ambition and ruthless cruelties of mankind
itself.</p>

<p>The characteristics, natural and human, which
we have remarked in the northern part of Central
America, as represented by the Republic of
Guatemala, are found in varying degree in the
sister States extending to the south. The general
topography of the isthmian region which Central
America embodies is that of a long backbone
of mountainous highlands extending from
Tehuantepec for eight hundred miles to the South
American mainland. The physiography of the
region, however, is associated with that of the
Antilles rather than the northern and southern
land masses, and its belts of volcanoes correspond
to those of the West Indies.</p>

<p>In earlier geological times the region probably
consisted of isolated stretches of land and mountains,
and before man appeared upon the earth
there may have been not one but several isthmian
"canals" or apertures, with the waters of the
Atlantic and Pacific intermixing therein. Alternately
rising and sinking&mdash;as evidenced by the
"drowned" Valley of the Chagres, on the site
of the Panama Canal, the land took on its present
form, in which, however, it may be that final
stability is not yet reached. It is fervently to
be hoped, however, that the particular belt traversed
by the Panama Canal will remain immune from
any earth movements, for that great work of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ingenuity, carried out at such enormous cost, might
otherwise be rendered useless in a single instant.</p>

<p>Panama, however, forms the extreme south of
Central America, and we must cast a glance at
the sequence of States below Guatemala.</p>

<p>Honduras is a land of considerable area, but
among the most backward portions of the region.
The efforts of its Government to encourage
economic and commercial development have not
been very well sustained and successful, and there
are only two towns in the Republic of any size,
one of which is the ancient capital Tegucigalpa,
picturesquely situated upon its river in an amphitheatre
of the hills, for Honduras is essentially
a land of mountains and depths, as its name signifies.
The great grassy plain of Comayagua,
however, which extends across the country, upon
which great herds of cattle feed, redeems the
land from too broken a condition. The city of
Comayagua was in earlier times the capital, but
it was ruined by the wars of the Central American
Federation, when, after an endeavour to establish
some form of political unification quarrels set in.</p>

<p>This little-known Republic has a long frontage
upon the Atlantic side, but only a few miles on
the Pacific, which, however, affords it an outlet
of corresponding importance at the picturesque
seaport of Amapala, on the beautiful Bay of
Fonseca. Indeed, this condition, of straddling a
continent, as it were, is one enjoyed by all the
Central American States, with the exception of
Salvador, which lies between the Pacific and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
backbone of the highlands. Otherwise, Honduras
is unfortunate in its means of communication: its
railways are few and short; its roads are difficult
of construction over the broken topography,
and in the absence of national funds and private
enterprise; and an attempt made of recent years
to inaugurate services of motor-cars did not meet
with success. However, a railway across from sea
to sea should be of national value, and the wealth
of the country, both agricultural and mineral, may
become more intensively developed.</p>

<p>The name of Honduras is almost a byword for
revolution, which occurs with marked regularity.</p>

<p>The colony or possession of British Honduras
lies in a commanding position between its neighbours
of Guatemala and Mexico on the west and
north, facing, on the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;under its
local name here of the Caribbean Sea&mdash;towards
the important island of Jamaica, some 600 miles
away.</p>

<p>Belize, as this foothold of the British Empire
is otherwise termed, is about the size of Wales,
and not unhealthy in comparison with the other
British possessions of tropical America. It is well
endowed with a wide variety of natural resources
and potentialities, but it cannot be said that its
economic progress is commensurate with its position.
One of the neglected offspring of Britain,
it is, like Demerara, an example of British national
and governmental supineness. It might have been
supposed that a people such as those of the United
Kingdom, urgently requiring for their teeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
millions of folk the things in foodstuffs and
material that the Tropics produce&mdash;things of the
grocer's shop and the store cupboard&mdash;would have
demanded a more vigorous administration and
development of this piece of national property,
but it is doubtful if one in a hundred would know
where or what British Honduras is.</p>

<p>We cannot here dwell at length upon its possibilities
and attractions. Approaching the capital,
Belize, from the sea, we pass the green islands that
fringe the coast, and extending along the banks
of the river we see the high roofs and wide
verandas of the houses and remark the coco-palm's
grateful shade. Often an invigorating breeze blows
from the sea, the same gales that crisp the surf
at Colon, which the traveller will inevitably note,
and this and the high tides wash the fever-bearing
mangrove swamps and marshes, rendering them
less unhealthy than otherwise would be the case.
The inhabitants are grateful for these tonic breezes
from the east upon this coastal belt.</p>

<p>This belt gives place in the interior to savannas,
pasture lands and forests of useful timber, which
latter is cut for export; and beyond are the
Cockscomb Mountains, the birthplace of numerous
streams.</p>

<p>In this interior region of British Honduras there
lie the remains of an ancient culture area, ruins
of buildings such as we see in Yucatan, the
adjacent part of Mexico, and in Guatemala on the
west. They appear to show the existence of a
larger population in pre-Colombian times&mdash;part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that undoubtedly clever and industrious ancient
folk of Central America who have so entirely
disappeared.</p>

<p>To the buccaneers of the Spanish Main the
colony largely owes its origin, and to the logwood
cutters. The coloured folk here are some of the
most expert woodmen in the world, and we see
the results of their labour in the rafts of timber&mdash;pine,
cedar and dyewood&mdash;being piloted down
the flood of the Belize River. These people
are descendants of the buccaneers, people of
European blood forming part of the population,
the majority of which is composed of a mixture,
the descendants of negro slaves, Indian and white
settlers. There is, of course, a small purely white
class, official, colonial and commercial, under
colony government from Britain.</p>

<p>The natural products here most in evidence are
the timbers, together with bananas and other
characteristic fruits, and coconuts, rubber, coffee,
cotton and fibre-producing plants; and gold and
other minerals are found and worked in small
degree.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be said that a description of
British Honduras is out of place in a book such
as the present, treating of Spanish America. But
geographical considerations would not thus be
denied. Further, this little outpost of the British
Empire, if it should always remain such, cannot
fail to influence, and to be influenced by, the
Spanish American civilization around it. It might
under better development accomplish much good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in this respect, if the policy of drift were
abandoned. A North American traveller who had
journeyed across the Central American Republics
and had been badgered unceasingly by revolutionary
strife there, and by customs-house officers
and others of the bureaucracy of those States, once
exclaimed that the only peaceful moment of his
journey was when he at length entered the confines
of a portion of "that hated British monarchy"&mdash;British
Honduras! This may have been an
exaggeration, but held something of truth.</p>

<p>The little Republic of Salvador, as already remarked,
lies upon the Pacific side of this interesting
isthmian region of Central America, but, small
in size, it is the most thickly populated and perhaps
the most prosperous and advanced of all this group
of States. Its capital, San Salvador, may be regarded
as a fine example of Spanish American
culture, and, with its buildings and institutions,
would compare more than favourably with a
European or North American town. The climate
and general character of the uplands upon which
it is situated, and the social atmosphere of the
place, are pleasing.</p>

<p>But the Pacific littoral is of that low and
monotonous character characteristic of the western
slope of much of Central America, and as a consequence
the ports are often difficult of access
through shoal water and heavy surf. The interior
is gained either from La Libertad or Acajutla, by
railway to the capital, ascending to 2,000 feet
above the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The Republic shares with Honduras and
Nicaragua the beautiful Bay of Fonseca, but this
beauty is characteristically associated with natural
terrors, for not far inland arises the dreaded San
Miguel volcano, one of the worst burning mountains
of Central America, ever threatening the life
of the capital. Upon this bay lies La Union, the
chief port of Salvador.</p>

<p>The Republic prides itself, and not unjustly, upon
the freedom of its life politically. But it is by
no means immune from the inevitable factional
strife of Central America, the ambition of dictators
and the evils brought about by such
corruption of self-government. However, many
foreigners carry on successful businesses in the
capital.</p>

<p>The population tends to increase with some
rapidity, and we shall remark the much smaller
proportion of Indians found here; the bulk of
the people, the <i>Ladinos</i>, being a mixture of white
and Indian, distributed throughout a number of
pleasing secondary towns, and, in the country districts,
are engaged in the production of coffee,
sugar, tobacco and other characteristic resources;
whilst the hills afford them those minerals with
which the region in general is dowered, with
some mining establishments, which, as usual, are
controlled by foreigners.</p>

<p>The economic life of Salvador is too greatly
dependent upon European markets and financial
centres; upon the export of coffee thereto; upon
the elevation or depression of such markets&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
condition, of course, common to many Spanish
American States, but which a better-ordered
regimen will seek to rectify.</p>

<p>We might wander long through the beautiful
scenery of Salvador, enjoying the grand and imposing
aspect of its volcanoes, the beauty of its
valleys and streams, for this part of Central
America is famed, or rather should be famed, for
the beauty of the landscape. Quaint towns and
curious products, the quiet and in some respects
pleasant life of its folk, the budding industries,
and a certain promise for the future leave a
pleasant impression upon the mind of the traveller
in this little State facing the broad Pacific.</p>

<p>Of the Republic of Nicaragua, which we may
approach either from the Atlantic or the Pacific,
and which is the largest of this group of States,
many dismal descriptions have been given. It is
described as economically and in civic conditions
the most backward. Yet some of its towns are
fine places. Leon was described as a splendid
city by travellers in 1665, and about that period
the very active buccaneer Dampier gathered rich
booty from it. Granada, founded by Cordova in
1523, was also one of the richest cities in Central
America, and it, too, gave up its toll of booty to
the corsairs. The Cathedral of Leon is one of
the most noteworthy, massive and ornate of the
great stone temples with which the Spaniards
endowed the New World, typical of the colonial
architecture which redeems these centres of life
from the prosaic vulgarity of some other lands.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>We may visit these towns from the line of railway
which runs from Corinto, the chief seaport
on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The capital of the Republic, the city of
Managua, is of less interesting character, and was,
in a measure, raised to that position in order to
put an end to the rivalry between Leon and
Granada, both of which claimed metropolitan predominance.
It is situated upon the great lake
of Nicaragua, the most prominent topographical
feature of this part of Central America, and
which, it will be recollected, was at one time
destined to form part of the waterway of a proposed
trans-isthmian canal in place of that of
Panama.</p>

<p>This great lake valley and its adjacent highlands
form the most plentifully inhabited part of
Nicaragua, as the Spanish colonial development
seized first upon its more fertile soil, watered by
the lake and streams. This civilization entered
the country from the Pacific side, from which we
remark the grim and distant ramparts of the
Central American Cordillera, with its volcanoes
intervening between the western versant and
littoral, and the low, monotonous and swampy
region of the east, and the Mosquito Coast
bordering upon the Atlantic. The Pacific
coast here is bold and rocky, with a headland
enclosing the Bay of Fonseca in Nicaraguan
territory.</p>

<p>Through the Cordillera flows the San Juan River,
draining this low eastern slope, and here lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
route of the projected Nicaraguan Canal, whose
abandonment caused bitter disappointment to the
people of the Republic.</p>

<p>In places in this wild land we remark the
remains of the pre-Colombian folk, who have left
vestiges of their temples and other structures, and
thus we realize once more how a chain of temple
and palace-building folk in ancient times was
carried down the length of the continents from
Mexico to Peru.</p>

<p>If too gloomy a description of the eastern side
of Nicaragua has been given, this must be
tempered by noting that it possesses certain natural
advantages which may render it one of the most
valuable districts, from an economic point of view,
in the whole of Central America. Its rivers may
be navigated by ocean-going steamers, and in the
Bluefields district the industry of banana production
and shipment has risen to very considerable
importance.</p>

<p>The name of Nicaragua comes from that
powerful native chief, Nicoya, who, when
the Spaniards first arrived, received Davila,
their leader, in a friendly spirit, and accepted
Christian baptism at the hands of the Roman
Catholic priests. But the Spaniards overran
the country; those who invaded it from the
east clashing with their own countrymen who
came in from the west, and Nicaragua's fine Indian
chief&mdash;pathetic page of native history&mdash;could not
conserve here anything of independence for the
rightful owners of the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish rulers of this unhappy land were
a dreadful band, of which it has been recorded
that "the first had been a murderer, the second
a murderer and a rebel, the third murdered the
second, the fourth was a forger, the fifth a murderer
and a rebel!"</p>

<p>In time the Indians revolted against intolerable
oppression, and, later, rebellion after rebellion
took place against the Mother Country. After
Independence, the Wars of the Confederation constantly
deluged the soil with blood, and the
political government of the State was distinguished
by a continuous series of military or civil revolts,
during which the land was impoverished, debased
and ruined, and from whose effects it has never
recovered so far.</p>

<p>Yet Nicaragua is rich in natural products, agricultural,
forestal and mineral.</p>

<p>Famous in local history is the name of the
North American filibuster, William Walker, who
for a space became president, and the doings of
this man and his band are stirringly adventurous.
The traveller will also recollect the long British
Protectorate over the Mosquito Coast.</p>

<p>But few remember that Nelson, the hero of
Trafalgar, nearly met his death from fever in
Nicaragua. The great sailor, sent to report upon
the prospect of a canal, stated his intention of
occupying Lake Nicaragua, which in his opinion
was "the inland Gibraltar of Spanish America,"
whose possession would permanently sunder
Spanish America into two parts. But Nature was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
against it. Nelson and his force ascended the river
to the lake and successfully attacked the Spanish
force. He was wounded by a cannon shot, fired
by a sixteen-year-old girl, wife of a Spanish officer,
and the maid was rewarded for the act by her
people.</p>

<p>Of Nelson's army of two hundred men all but
ten perished of fever, and left their bones in the
soil of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>In the adjoining States of Costa Rica and
Panama we are approaching the narrowing, curving
form of the isthmus, whose topography culminates
in the famous neck of land which joins the twin
continents of America together, and which has
been severed to give access between the world's
greatest oceans, in the great Canal.</p>

<p>Whence the name of Costa Rica? Their eyes
ever sharp to the glint of gold, the Spaniards
who approached Central America from the sea
immediately remarked that the swarthy forms of
the Indians were decorated with trinkets of yellow
metal. The savages wore earrings of gold, which
dangled invitingly from their scared countenances
when the bearded and armoured white warriors
approached, and there was little ceremony in the
transference of ownership. "This is a rich coast!
This is <i>Costa Rica</i>!" the Spaniards exclaimed.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was part of the old culture area of
Chiriqui, whose folk were clever producers of
native jewellery in gold and precious stones.
Pedro de Alvarado called the whole region,
including Salvador, Cuscatan, the native Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
name, meaning "Land of precious stones, of
treasures and abundance." But here in Costa
Rica the greedy Iberians found disappointingly
little gold, except for these trinkets. This region
was the limit of the Maya civilization.</p>

<p>To-day Costa Rica is a flourishing little State,
with fertile soil and bright sunshine, with many
luscious fruits, with food in plenty, famous for its
splendid coffee, special product of the volcanic
earth: a land of small peasant owners, upon which
is founded some political stability and civic prosperity,
an example to other Spanish American
States, where oligarchies monopolize the countryside,
and the labourer dwells in peonage.</p>

<p>The Pacific coast here displays as we approach
it, bold headlands and broad bays, among them
the Gulf of Nicoya, the home of that pious-minded
Indian chief, who, as before described, gave his
name to the adjoining State of Nicaragua.
Studded with richly wooded islands, and famous
for its purple-yielding murex (the beautiful ancient
dye of the whelk), its pearls and mother-of-pearl,
is this bay, from which, leaving our steamer
at the port of Punta Arenas, we may ascend by
railway to the pleasing capital of San José de
Costa Rica, on a plateau between the Cordillera
at an elevation of nearly 4,000 feet above the
ocean.</p>

<p>Here we are in a well-advanced city, the amenities
of whose public life are creditable to Central
America. The line runs on and descends to Puerto
Limon, on the Atlantic, thus crossing the isthmus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>But, like its neighbours, Costa Rica stands
perennially in awe of the volcanoes which top the
summit of the Cordillera. Turialba, ever hot and
angry, and Poas are among these, pouring forth
smoke and vapour.</p>

<p>Let us take our stand a moment on Irazu,
11,000 feet above the sea&mdash;we may reach it on
horseback&mdash;higher than the summit of the
Pyrenees, and looking east and west remark the
vast horizons which unfold below: on the one
hand we see the gleaming waters of the Atlantic,
on the other those of the Pacific, whilst, between,
the whole expanse of the country unfolds. Here,
indeed, may the inhabitant of Costa Rica cast
a glance over the whole domain of his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patria</i>,
and let fancy wander over the realms of ocean
towards Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Costa Rica was peopled largely by Spaniards
from Galicia, but the bulk of the folk are to-day
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ladinos</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mestizos</i>, and, where the native tribes
have not been exterminated, there are Indians still
in complete savagery. The land is one of the
healthiest in the region we are treading, and its
products of fruits and foods, of timber, tortoise-shell,
rubber, cedar, mahogany, ebony, and great
stores of bananas, give to the land a further claim
to the name of the Rich Coast.</p>

<p>And now our vessel floats upon the beautiful
Bay of Panama, studded with verdant isles, and
if perchance it be the sunset hour the flashing
colour of the sky may light up the towers of the
old colonial city near its shore, a romantic haven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
whose memories of Drake and of the cruel Morgan,
of Nuñez de Balboa, of Pizarro, and all that
gallery of bygone adventurers who made the
history of the New World upon these tropic shores.
The sun does not rise, however, in the Bay of
Panama, but sets, for the curvature of the isthmus
has disoriented us, at Panama.</p>

<p>This independent Republic of Panama threw off
its allegiance to Colombia, whose heritage the
isthmus was, in a grandiloquent manifesto after
the&mdash;alleged&mdash;machinations of the Americans,
who, wearied of the dilatory tactics of the parent
State, laid hands on the isthmus to carry out their
cherished plan of making the Canal. "Just as a
son withdraws from his paternal roof, so the
isthmian people, in adopting the destiny they have
chosen, do so with grief, but in compliance with the
supreme and inevitable duty the country owes to
itself. Upon separating from our brethren of
Colombia, we do so without hatred and without
joy." So ran the manifesto.</p>

<p>But the people of Bogata, of Colombia, consider
that an unspeakable outrage was perpetuated upon
them, and regard the United States and its then
President, Roosevelt, as its author&mdash;an outrage
which time will take long to heal.</p>

<p>We shall see something of the doings of the
immortal Drake in our journey down the great
Pacific coast of South America, undertaken in
another chapter.</p>

<p>The Panama Isthmus was to Drake a vantage
point, from which he viewed a promised land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
After his attack on Nombre de Dios, a fugitive
slave&mdash;a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cimarron</i>&mdash;conducted him and his followers
to the summit of the isthmian hills. There
lay before Drake the gleaming waters of the vast
Pacific, as they had lain before Balboa. Drake
fell on his knees. He prayed to sail those waters
in an English ship. It was partly his destined
work of "Singeing the King of Spain's beard."
Back to England he went. The commission which
Queen Elizabeth had given him to sail the Spanish
Main had been honourably accomplished, even if
the Spaniards at Cartagena and elsewhere did not
so regard it. The queen must extend the charter
to the Pacific. She did it, and Drake's exploits
there and return home westwards are among
the most thrilling annals of those "spacious
days."</p>

<p>Hear a tale now of Morgan the buccaneer, and
Panama, and the dreadful things that befel that
city. Young Morgan, born in Wales, kidnapped
for a sailor in the streets of Bristol, also sailed
the Spanish Main. Drake was a gentleman;
Morgan seems to have been a bloody-minded
corsair. At thirty-three years of age he sacked
Porto Bello, committing frightful cruelties and excesses.
But at Panama he surpassed himself. Yet
praise must be given him for his bravery and
resource.</p>

<p>Ascending the Chagres River from Colon in
boats, with a dreadful struggle over the hills,
Morgan and his men, like Drake and Balboa,
beheld the Pacific beyond. Whether he prayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for success or not history does not record. But
there lay the rich city of Panama. It must be
taken. It was defended by hundreds of Spaniards.
But Morgan had taken Chagres and killed three
hundred Spaniards there, and double his own
number at Panama did not daunt him. Down
they went to Panama. The enterprise was a tough
one, but the result may be seen to-day in the
massive ruins of the old city, a sight for sightseers,
buried in the jungle some miles from the present
city. For within a few hours the buccaneers
attacked and slew its defenders and burned the
place with fire, leaving but an empty shell, having
robbed it of its treasure, excepting that which
an escaping plate ship bore safely from his
clutches.</p>

<p>It has been said in extenuation of Morgan's
doings here that the place was in reality burned
by the Indians and the slaves, who were animated
by the most bitter hatred of the Spaniards, and
were quite ready to assist the Englishmen.</p>

<p>The isthmus resounded for more than a century
with the tramp of mules bearing gold and silver
from the Pacific plate ships; the treasures of Peru,
of Bolivia, the pearls of Nicoya and the isles, the
gold and silver stripped from the Inca temples,
the silver bars from Potosi, the silver mountain
of the Andes. Along that dreadful trail the mule-trains
groaned their way. It was a rough road
for horsemen.</p>

<p>The trail became, as time went on, one of the
world's greatest trade routes, under the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the Spanish Colonies. We have seen how
the great Nelson hoped to split these colonies in
two by establishing a "Gibraltar" on Lake
Nicaragua. A toll of human life has been paid
upon this rugged path for every human movement
over it. Has it not been said that for every sleeper
in the first Panama railway a human being died
in the terrors of construction? If it is not true, it
is true that of the eight hundred Chinamen who
left the Flowery Kingdom to build the line&mdash;labourers
who knew nothing of the horrors that
awaited them in this fever death-bed&mdash;many committed
suicide. Crowds of labouring peasantry
from Ireland found here, too, a more emerald
grave, and hordes of negroes filled up with their
poor bodies any vacant tombs.</p>

<p>Punishment fell upon this railway, for, according
to an American writer, it degenerated until its rails
"became nothing but two streaks of rust."</p>

<p>Another tale of Darien the fateful: Listen, ye
sons of Scotia, to the story of one William
Paterson, and his New Edinburgh. Not content
with having founded the Bank of England, Paterson
must fight the great East India Company, and
with another enterprising "interloper" he got
over-subscribed, a company with a capital of
£600,000, and set sail for the isthmus "amid the
tears and prayers" of half Scotland. The new
settlement was "to hold the key of the world's
commerce." "Universal free trade" with all the
world was to be maintained; all differences of race
and religion were to be annulled in this Utopia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Death, fever, loss, the attacks of the Spaniards
and complete disaster&mdash;such was the answer of
Fate to their enterprise, and of the two thousand
trustful souls who left the Clyde in the closing
year of the seventeenth century for this desired
haven of the Spanish Main, a few hundreds alone
returned to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Paterson's idea was in reality that of a great
empire-builder. It was a magnificent scheme,
and only lacked the element of success. England
might have possessed another India, and in the
New World. The Scotch were fully alive to the
position, but the English were stupid, and lost an
enormous opportunity.</p>

<p>The making of the Panama Canal has greatly
appealed to the imagination of the world, although
its triumph, in a spectacular sense, was interfered
with by the rise of the Great War. Here was a
wild isthmus which cut off the Atlantic from the
Pacific, Europe from Asia to the west. An
isthmus which, whilst it formed a barrier between
two oceans, did not, nevertheless, serve as a bridge
between two continents: those of North and South
America. Its construction is an epic of engineering,
and, be it added, of medical skill, for without
the latter the former would have been of no avail.
What has been picturesquely described as the
"Conquest of the mosquito," also the conquest of
malaria and yellow fever, enabled this work to
be done. Formerly the traveller hurried fearfully
from his steamer at Colon by rail across the neck
to Panama, and if his journey lay beyond to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
steamer at Panama, anxious to leave the deadly
region as soon as were possible. Now no such
anxiety marks his journey.</p>

<p>The fight against the natural obstacles to the
work&mdash;those of climate, of inefficient labour, of
mountainous cuttings, of floods, of finance and
political intrigue, and all else, was brought to an
end&mdash;or mainly so&mdash;in November 1913, four
hundred years after Balboa's dramatic discovery
of the Pacific from the "Peak in Darien"; when
a vast concourse of people witnessed the great
explosion that blew up the last barrier, and a small
steamer, the little French steamboat <i>Louise</i>, which,
twenty-five years before had conveyed de Lesseps
to turn the first sod, passed completely, on its own
keel, across from Atlantic to Pacific waters&mdash;an
act of American courtesy to France.</p>

<p>Several lessons were learned by the construction
of the Panama Canal. One was that corruption
and inertia among officials will ruin all effort, as
it did with the French&mdash;who, however, did very
valuable work on the Canal. Another that, with
modern appliances and just methods, even so
stupendous a work could be carried to success,
even in the face of enormous natural obstacles;
that the obstacles raised by Nature are less formidable
than those man raises himself.</p>

<p>Another lesson was in the methods of overcoming
the dreadful tropical diseases of yellow
fever and malaria.</p>

<p>The last lesson was in the treatment of labour,
in this case that of the negro; a matter of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
importance to all tropical lands, which may justify
here a few words.</p>

<p>A great part of the labour employed on the
Canal, in fact, the majority of it later, was that
of the West Indian negro, largely from Barbadoes.
But it was soon found that this labour was very
inefficient. The negro would not or could not
"put his back" into the work. In 1906 an
American commission appointed to investigate conditions,
reported upon the impossibility of concluding
the job with negro labour. "Not only do they
seem to be disqualified by lack of actual vitality,
but their disposition to labour seems to be as frail
as their bodily strength," ran the report. The
negro was, in fact, roundly cursed as a lazy or
incapable hound.</p>

<p>But some, wiser than others, thought there must
be a cause below this inertia. Such, indeed, was
found to be the case. It was shown that the
negro either could not afford, or was too idle to
prepare, proper food for himself; in short, that he
was ill-nourished. A few bananas, and whatever
else the difficult conditions of the isthmus afforded,
formed his meals. It was then resolved that he
must be properly fed and housed. A commissariat
was set up, at which the negro was obliged to
take his meals, and the bare cost was deducted
from his wages. No profit was to be made. The
system answered admirably; the actual cost was
found to be only thirty cents American money,
equal to about one shilling and threepence, for a
day's board of good food. The result was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the negro performed entirely satisfactory labour,
and he practically built the Canal.</p>

<p>Many writers have sung of the deeds of the
Canal building, which must always furnish a
thrilling story of the triumph of human genius, and
we need not enter upon it here.</p>

<p>The Great War over, the American fleet&mdash;which
had played a valuable and noble part&mdash;accomplished,
in July 1919, a spectacular passage of
the Canal, which brings us to-day again to realize
the strategic value of the waterway. Some two
hundred vessels of war, flying the Stars and
Stripes, including six Dreadnoughts, embodying the
American Pacific fleet, entered the eastern end of
the Canal as the sun was rising in the Spanish
Main. But before the orb of day had turned its
"westering wheel" into the bosom of the Pacific,
the great procession had passed through the Canal
and was ruffling the waters of that great sea, thus
accomplishing in a few hours, a passage which
the battleship <i>Oregon</i>, during the American war
with Spain in 1898, had taken nearly two weeks
to make, around the South American Continent.</p>

<p>The Americans have fortified the Canal, but
blockading would be in contravention of the
Hay-Pauncefote Treaty with England; and
indeed it is to be hoped and believed that the
United States will prove a conscientious guardian
of her charge and creation. Yet the future may
have much in store in this region for good or ill.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic descriptions of the possibility of the
Canal to commerce have been written, in the shortening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of distances, in the "shrinkage of the world,"
and there is no doubt of its great utility, which
it is not, however, needful to exaggerate. Since
the project was conceived and executed, the world
has learned that more than the passage of armaments
and argosies of merchandise are requisite
for the stability and progress of mankind.</p>

<p>A glance now at the general life of the people
of these States.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the aggregate the population numbers somewhat
over five million souls, but they tend to
increase more rapidly than others of the Spanish
American countries, or at least in some of the
Republics, for the native women are prolific, and
mortality is low, due to the comparatively easy conditions
of life and the beneficence of Nature. In
some districts illegitimacy, both among whites and
Indians, is very marked, and the economic condition
in a modern sense is a low one. Primary
education is generally compulsory, the Governments
generally making considerable parade of educational
intentions, but, withal, only a small proportion
of the population can read and write.
Naturally this is true mainly of the Indian and
lower class mixed race.</p>

<p>As to food, this is mainly such vegetable products
as maize, beans and bananas, and at times
jerked meat. Excessive drinking is a frequent
attribute of all Spanish American folk of the working
classes, and it is not in the financial interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of their masters to stint the supply of liquors, the
fiery <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aguadientes</i> or spirits, which are so remunerative
a product of the sugar-cane plantations, possessions
of the large landowners frequently. The
Indians are generally a peaceful folk, however,
except when under the influence of liquor, and they
have many good qualities, which it is time should
now be more beneficently and wisely fostered by
those in whose hands their destiny so greatly lies.</p>

<p>The Central American States are dowered, as
regards Nature, with almost everything that could
make a people happy and prosperous. The varying
elevations of their lands above sea-level afford
every variety of climate, and consequently of food
product and industrial material. They can enjoy
their own beef and corn, produced in their highlands,
or, descending to the torrid strip of their
coasts, gather coffee, cocoa, bananas, oranges,
sugar-cane, and a variety of fruits which tempt
both the eye and the palate. As for their minerals,
the precious metals of gold and silver in the hills
could provide sufficient for their uses and to spare,
the baser for manufactures. The timber of the
forests is rich and varied, the fibrous plants are
of innumerable uses.</p>

<p>The noble landscapes which open to the view,
of wooded mountains and majestic peak, of
romantic river valley, and the blue line of the
tropic sea, are such as might well bring out those
attributes of the poet and the artist which exist
in the Spanish American mentality.</p>

<p>In brief, there are here, in each State, the elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of a quiet and pleasing existence, far, it is
true, from the world's more ambitious centres, but
nevertheless capable of producing peace and plenty.
Alas! however, for the unsettled temperament
which cannot yet assimilate the bounties of Providence
in such method as shall ensure their
equitable enjoyment.</p>

<p>To the foreign traveller, Central America might
afford an extremely pleasing field of travel. There
is a charm in the remains of the prehistoric
American cultures, the carved walls of the old
temples, the buried idols, the ancient industries.
Restful and quaint are these little towns with the
stamp of the Spanish Colonial architecture. Here
man and Nature soon forget the bloodshed and the
enmity of the torn and stained pages of history.
The simple folk of the countryside are full of
courtesy, the needs of life are cheap and plentiful,
for the earth is bountiful. All these are elements
which impress themselves upon the mind of the
traveller here.</p>

<p>This, then, is Central America, that region so
slightly known to the world outside that, as elsewhere
remarked, its very geographical position is
often a matter of doubt. But, in the future&mdash;it
may be distant&mdash;it cannot be doubted that, with its
advantages, the region must play a more important
part in the developing world.</p>

<p>Three Latin American island-Republics enclose
the Caribbean Sea and Spanish Main to the north:
those of Cuba, Hayti, and Santo Domingo, upon
which, however, we cannot here dilate at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature has, in general, endowed these regions
of the Antilles with great beauty, but man, in their
past history, has made them the scene of the utmost
cruelty, first by the Spaniards, in the ill-treatment
and extermination of the gentle and harmless
natives, and second, in the slave trade.</p>

<p>Cuba stretches its long, thin bulk from the
Yucatan Strait, off the Mexican coast, and the line
is continued by the Island of Hayti, containing
the Republic of that name, the famous Hispaniola
of the days of the Conquistadores, now a French-speaking
negro State, and Santo Domingo, whose
capital, the oldest settlement in the New World,
founded in 1496, may be regarded as the most
perfect example of a sixteenth-century Spanish
town. Its cathedral contains the reputed burial
place of Columbus.</p>

<p>No countries in the world excel these lands in
the variety and richness of their tropical products,
and in the beauty of their scenery. Havana, the
handsome capital of Cuba, was the last stronghold
of Spain in America, the Spanish flag flying there
until the time of the war between Spain and the
United States in 1899. The American attitude
towards Cuba revealed the wisdom and generosity
of the great Anglo-Saxon Republic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our way now lies to the north, into Mexico, that
buffer-state between the Spanish American and the
Anglo - American civilizations, which, upon its
frontier, roll together but do not mingle.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>ANCIENT AND MODERN MEXICO</h3>


<p>Of all the lands of the New World, none perhaps
has impressed itself more on the imagination than
the picturesque and enigmatical land of Mexico.
It seems to stand, in our thoughts of distant
countries, apart from all others, a riddle we cannot
read, surrounded by a halo or mist of unreality, a
region vague and shadowy as its Toltec ancestors.</p>

<p>Perhaps this view has in part arisen from the
description of the Conquest by famous writers,
which so greatly interested our forbears of the
Victorian period, and by the romantic story-writers
of the same era. But these matters alone would
not account for the hazy atmosphere surrounding
the old land of the Aztecs, which even the prosaic
matters of trade and finance do not seem to lift.
There are many English and American folk with
commercial interests in Mexico, who draw perhaps,
or in happier times there have drawn, dividends
from their investment in mine, or railway, or
other enterprise; but even this material standpoint
fades into intangibility before the endeavour to
form a true mental image of the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Who are the Mexicans, where does their country
lie, what language do they speak, what dress do
they wear? Geography and ethnology will furnish
us with the most exact replies; the books of
travellers will fill in abundant detail, but nevertheless,
Mexico remains for us an enigma.</p>

<p>We shall not hope here successfully to dispel this
mystery, even though we may have been there,
traversed its varied surface, and lived among its
people. To say that Mexico is the Egypt of the
New World, whilst it is not untrue, is to deepen
the atmosphere. The sandalled Indian creeps
across his desert sands and irrigates them with
his native torrents as he did in centuries past,
lives in his wattle or adobe hut, and, if he no
longer worships the sun, at least he stands before
its morning rays to embrace its warmth&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">el capa de
los pobres</i> ("the poor man's cloak")&mdash;for poverty
denies him other comfort. The rich man is clothed
in fine textures of European model and may dwell
in a palace, but beneath his modernized exterior
are traits of the Orient, and the blood of the Moor,
the Goth, the Vandal, the Roman, the Celt, the
Semite, brought hither in the Spaniard, is mingled
with that of the Aztec, who lived upon the great
plateau and built his temples of strange and bloody
worship.</p>

<p>No other American nation constitutes so wide a
blending of original races. Spain itself was a
veritable crucible of languages, peoples and creeds,
whilst aboriginal Mexico contained a large number
of tribes, each with their particular culture, or lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of such.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> For Mexico, it is to be recollected,
was not a land like the United States or Canada,
which contained, relatively, but a few bands of
Indians, without any particular form of government
or developed institutions.</p>

<p>The grandees of Spain came out to rule this
diversified land, and they did not disdain to make
it their home. Spain gave it of her best often,
with capable legislators, laws; the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ley de Indias</i>,
enacted for the benefit of the colonies, and erudite
professors and devout&mdash;over-devout&mdash;ecclesiastics;
and these often carried out their work with
patriotism and fervency. Although it is not yet,
the student of history will be fain to think that out
of this seed a good growth must in the future
come to being, and this we may say without any
unnecessary apologetics for Mexico.</p>

<p>But what, we may ask, is the influence here,
that throws back this fruitful land from time
to time to anarchy, and makes its name a
byword?</p>

<p>Disorder and treachery periodically arises, dictator
succeeds dictator, revolution follows revolution,
and the country's soil, whether in the streets
of its capital, whether upon its desert plains or in
its tropic valleys, is drenched with the blood of its
own sons. The results of thirty years of a constructive
national policy which Diaz gave, the hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and pretensions of a high civilization, laboriously
built up, sink down to nought, revert to the conditions
of that dreadful half-century that followed
upon Independence, from which stand forth the
names&mdash;noble and ignoble&mdash;of Iturbide, Maximilian,
Juarez, or Morelos. What ails this strange
land? Is it capable of no better life?</p>

<p>In reply, Mexico is a land following the inevitable
law of reaping what it has sown, and both the
sowing and the reaping are but exaggerated forms
of processes that are affecting the world at large.
Judgment must not be too heavily passed upon
Mexico as a whole, for, as I shall later show, a
whole nation must not be condemned by reason of
some of its nationals.</p>

<p>Mexico, like all Spanish American States, is at
the mercy, politically and economically, of certain
small sections of the people. Government is of an
oligarchy in normal times, which often abuses its
position. The bulk of the people have neither
art nor part in their own governance. The ballot
box is too often a delusion and a snare. A turbulent
or ambitious element can seize power at
any moment by a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">golpe de estado</i> (a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i>).
The upper and refined class, which, be it said, is
the equivalent of and as well-informed often as that
in Europe, stand aloof from political revolution and
disturbance, and would be the last to commit the
excesses which bring execration upon the country's
name. The educated Mexican has all the traditions
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</i>, the gentleman; the Mexican
lady is refined, devout, delicate and tenderhearted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The peon and the Indian are not turbulent, but
well-meaning and generally industrious.</p>

<p>These matters we shall further consider; for the
moment let us pass on to survey the land itself,
to traverse its wide and diversified surface, with
its many elements of beauty, interest and utility.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a land of vast extent, in which
various European countries could be contained;
stretching from the borders of Central America
northward to those of the United States, two
thousand miles long upon its major axis, shaped
upon the map like a cornucopia, washed on one
side by the Atlantic, on the other by the Pacific,
and containing within itself every resource of Nature
which could make for plenty and progress. Its
southern half lies within the Tropics, but consisting
in great part of an elevated tableland, where the
diurnal range of temperature&mdash;from the heat of the
day to the cold of the night&mdash;is so considerable
that latitude we find is not a reliable guide to
climate.</p>

<p>This great plateau, whose escarpments, viewed
as we approach from either side present the
appearance of mountains, is in large part sterile,
treeless, and without rivers of importance or navigability.
But it is crossed by ranges of steely-blue
hills and intersected by fertile valleys, where agriculture
is carried on under irrigation&mdash;an ancient
art by means of canals fed from the intermittent
streams. Cacti, strange and gaunt, clothe it by
nature, but there are large coniferous forests upon
the mountain slopes in places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Do we approach the country from the north, by
the railway lines from the United States border,
we traverse deserts among the most dreadful of
the New World, deserts yet with a certain cruel
beauty of their own, where once the Apache
roamed&mdash;cruellest and most horrible of all the
world's savage folk.</p>

<p>But Nature has disposed along this high plateau,
vast, fabulously vast mineral wealth, and from the
famous mines of Guanajuato, Zacatecas, Chihuahua,
Durango, Potosi, Aguascalientes, Pachuca;
and places&mdash;some of them noble towns, dowered
with royal charters before the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed for
New England&mdash;silver and gold poured forth to fill
the needy coffers of Spain. Later, the English
shareholder tried his hands upon the "mother-lode"
with varying fortune, and copper, iron and
other metals also came like magic from the rocks
of this great wilderness.</p>

<p>On the eastern and western versants of the
country, and in the south, we encounter a different
landscape. Here Nature smiles. In places it may
be hot and humid, perhaps malarious, with tangled
forests. But rich vegetation, gorgeous flora and
profuse animal life&mdash;bird, insect, reptile&mdash;abound.
Here are fruitful plains and valleys, vast sugar-cane
plantations, luscious fruits of kinds unknown
to the world outside&mdash;among them the <i>mamey</i>, the
"fruit of the Aztec kings," with orange and banana
groves, coffee gardens, cocoa-trees, yielding the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chocolatl</i> of the Aztecs, rubber-trees with elegant
foliage, whilst above, the graceful coco-palm rears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
its stately column and feathery plume high against
the azure sky.</p>

</div>

<p>Here, indeed, is a region where it might have
been supposed that man could dwell in peace and
plenty, with a minimum of toil and ambition, of
care and evil.</p>

<p>The climatic zones of Mexico were named by
the Spaniards in accordance with the condition of
their varying temperatures respectively, as, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tierra Caliente</i>, or hot lands, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tierra Templada</i>,
or temperate lands, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tierra Fria</i>, or cold
lands: the first lying upon the coast, the second
midway up the slopes, and the last the higher
regions, reaching an elevation of 8,000 to 10,000
feet and more above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>In this intermediate zone of the Tierra Templada
lies a land which has been not unjustly termed a
region of perpetual spring, a truly desirable land,
where the fortunate inhabitant lives close to the
kindly earth as if in some mortal paradise&mdash;as far
as Nature is concerned. In the high zone, healthful
and invigorating, lies the beautiful city of Mexico
in its enclosed valley; and many a handsome town
is found throughout the three zones.</p>

<p>This city of Mexico was the coveted prize of
Cortes and his Spaniards, and through the varying
zones they passed after having, on that Good
Friday in 1519, landed on the shores to which
they gave the name of Vera Cruz&mdash;the place of the
True Cross. Across the waters of the Gulf as
they approached the unknown land was seen the
gleaming peak of Orizaba, called by the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Citlalteptl, or the Mountain of the Star, hanging
in mid-heaven, its point over thirteen thousand feet
above the sea.</p>

<p>From the shore, the native runners of Montezuma
bore swiftly upwards to the mountain city
news of the white man's arrival&mdash;long expected
of old, from the traditions of Quetzalcoatl, the
mystic god-man of white race. These messengers
made curious but faithful "picture-writings," on
Mexican paper, of the great "water-houses" or
caravels swinging in the bay, the dread "men-animals"
or horsemen, and the thunderous guns of
the Spaniards, and hastened thence to warn their
master.</p>

<p>Swiftly they returned from the mountains. "Go
back," the Aztec Emperor said, "come not hither,
the road is long and difficult," and he sent presents&mdash;a
huge wheel of gold and beautiful feather work
and other objects.</p>

<p>But Cortes, heeding not the message, burned
his boats; the customary Mass was rendered by
the Padre Olmedo&mdash;the Spaniards were always
devout, partly in sincerity, partly as a custom&mdash;and
the adventurers set forth on that remarkable
and adventurous journey which forms one of the
most thrilling episodes in early American history.
Let us briefly review it.</p>

<p>The Spaniards have allied themselves, in the
fruitful land of Tlascala&mdash;the "Land of Bread"
in the native tongue&mdash;with the Tlascalans, foes at
first but friends afterwards, and then began the
most stirring events of their march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Tlascalans were a people who had developed
a remarkable civilization and social and
military organization, akin to that of the Aztecs.
On the arrival of the messengers of Cortes much
dissension had prevailed in their councils, some of
the chiefs&mdash;the community was ruled by a council
of four&mdash;maintaining that this was an opportunity
for vengeance against their hereditary enemies, the
hated Aztecs and their prince, Montezuma. 'Let
us ally ourselves with these terrible strangers,' they
urged, 'and march against the Mexicans.' For
the doings of the Spaniards had echoed through
the land already, with a tale of smitten tribes and
broken idols. But the wily old Xicotencatl thought
otherwise. 'What do we know of their purpose?'
was his counsel; so it was agreed that the army
of the Tlascalans and Otomies, who were in force
near the frontier, under the command of the fiery
young warrior&mdash;son of old Xicotencatl, and bearing
the same name&mdash;should attack them. 'If we
fail,' the old barbarian urged, 'we will disavow
the act of our general; if we win&mdash;&mdash;'!</p>

<p>"The stone fortification at the valley's end had
been undefended, and with Cortes at their head
the Spaniards entered Tlascalan territory. Skirmishing
was followed by a pitched battle between
the Christians and the Tlascalans, in which the
firearms and lances of the Spaniards wrought
terrible havoc on their antagonists. Astounded at
the sight of the horses&mdash;those extraordinary beings,
whether of animal or demoniacal origin they knew
not&mdash;and appalled by the thundering of the guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which seemed to have some superhuman source,
the Tlascalans at first fell back. But they overcame
their fears, fell savagely upon the invaders,
and were with difficulty repulsed, having managed
to kill two of the horses. Greatly to Cortes's
regret was this, for the noble animals were few,
and&mdash;more serious still&mdash;their death removed that
semi-superstitious dread regarding them, which the
natives held. However, the Spaniards afterwards
buried them from sight.</p>

<p>"Night fell, a season when the Indians fought
not, but on the morrow the messengers which had
been sent to the Tlascalans arrived&mdash;having escaped&mdash;with
the news that the enemy was approaching
in great force. So indeed it befel, and upon the
plain in front of the Spaniards appeared a mighty
host, varyingly estimated between thirty and a
hundred thousand warriors. The Spaniards with
their allies numbered&mdash;fearful odds!&mdash;about three
thousand. 'The God of the Christians will bear
us through,' said the brave and beautiful Marina.
A frightful battle now ensued, the issue of which
hung in the scale for hours. Charging, volleying,
borne this way and that by the flood of the enemy's
numbers, the gallant band of the Spaniards
snatched victory from almost certain defeat, their
superior weapons and cavalry, together with the
bad tactics of the Indians, who knew not how to
employ their unwieldy army to best advantage, at
length decided the day for the Christians, who
inflicted terrible punishment upon their foes. The
Tlascalans' policy now showed signs of weakening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
but further assaults were necessary, and some
treachery, under the guise of friendship, having
been discovered on the part of the fifty Tlascalan
envoys to the Spanish camp, Cortes barbarously
cut off the hands of these and sent them back to
tell the tale.</p>

<p>"The upshot of these engagements was that
the Tlascalans capitulated, apologized for their
conduct, invited the strangers to take possession of
their capital, and assured them that they would
now be allies, not enemies, of the white men, who
were undoubtedly the representative of the great
and long-expected Quetzalcoatl. The joy in the
Spanish camp at this turn of affairs knew no
bounds; well did the Spaniards know that the
continued opposition of the Indians would have
been their ruin, whilst in their alliance was salvation
and the key to the Conquest.</p>

<p>"Behold the war-worn and hungry Spaniards,
lean and tattered from marching and privations
in the inclement uplands, now installed in comfort
in the centre of the powerful Tlascalan capital.
Forth had come to greet them young Xicotencatl,
who, to do him justice, took upon himself the
responsibility of the war; and as the Spaniards
entered the capital the streets were lined with
men, women and children, and decorated with
garlands of flowers as for a triumphal procession.
The old chief who had urged for opposition now
changed his tactics, and as Cortes entered he embraced
him, passing his hand over the face of the
Spaniard to see what manner of man he was, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the aged Tlascalan was blind, having reached, it
has been said&mdash;probably with exaggeration&mdash;a
hundred and forty years of age! 'The city is
much larger than Granada,' wrote Cortes to
Carlos V, with a description of its markets, shops,
houses and intelligent and industrious population.</p>

<p>"Six weeks the Spaniards sojourned there, recuperating
their energies, living on the best the
plentiful land afforded&mdash;Tlascala signified in the
Indian tongue 'the land of bread'&mdash;taking wives
from among the maidens, the chiefs' daughters,
and endeavouring, first with the foolish haste of
Cortes and then with the slow prudence of Father
Olmedo, to instil some tenets of the Christian
religion into their hosts. But religious fervour had
to give way to material necessities, and the Tlascalan
idols remained unsmitten, although their
human sacrifices were somewhat stayed.</p>

<p>"Rested and mended, the Spaniards now set
impatient gaze upon the oak- and fir-clad mountain
slopes which bounded the valley. Above them
loomed upward the great Malinche, snow-capped
queen of the Tlascalan mountain fastnesses; and
still the friendly Tlascalans, stern foes but noble
allies, loaded them with every favour and bid them
tarry. When, however, they would stay no longer
they raised a great body of warriors to accompany
them, warning Cortes against the wiles of Montezuma.
'Beware of his presents and his promises;
he is false and seeks your destruction,' they urged,
and their implacable hatred of the Aztecs showed
itself in their words and mien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Contrary to the advice of their new allies, the
Spaniards decided to journey on to Mexico through
Cholula, the land of the great pyramid. Embassies
had arrived, both from Montezuma and from the
Cholulans, the latter inviting the Spaniards to go
that way; and the great Aztec monarch, swayed
now by the shadow of oncoming destiny, offering
the Spaniards a welcome to his capital. 'Trust not
the Tlascalans, those barbarous foes,' was the
burden of his message, 'but come through friendly
Cholula: a greeting received by the Tlascalans
with sneers and counter-advice. The purpose of the
Tlascalans was not a disinterested one. An attack
upon Montezuma was their desire, and preliminary
to this they hoped to embroil the Spaniards
with the perfidious Cholulans. Another embassy&mdash;and
this was an important event&mdash;had waited upon
Cortes. It was from the Ixtlilxochitl, one of the
rival claimants for the throne of Texcoco, which,
it will be remembered, was a powerful and
advanced community in confederation with the
Aztecs; and Cortes was not slow to fan the flame
of disaffection which this indicated, by an encouraging
message to the young prince.</p>

<p>"A farewell was taken of the staunch Tlascalans,
the invariable Mass was celebrated by Father
Olmedo, and, accompanied by a large body of
Tlascalan warriors, the Spaniards set out for
Cholula. What befel in this beautiful and populous
place&mdash;which, Bernal Diaz wrote, reminded him,
form its numerous towers, of Valladolid&mdash;was of
terrible and ruthless import. Cholula, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
great <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocalli</i>, was the Mecca of Anahuac, and was
veritably a land flowing with milk and honey.
Well-built houses, numerous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocallis</i>, or pyramidal
temples, well-dressed people with embroidered
cloaks, and numbers of censer-swinging priests
formed the <i>ensemble</i> which greeted the Spaniards'
eyes, whilst the intense cultivation of the ground
and the fields of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maguey</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maiz</i>, and other products,
irrigated by canals from the mountain streams,
formed the environment of this advanced community.
'Not a palm's-breadth of land that is not
cultivated,' wrote Cortes in his dispatches to
Castile, 'and the city, as we approached, was more
beautiful than the cities of Spain.' Beautiful and
gay doubtless Cholula was when the Spaniards
entered; drenched with the blood of its inhabitants
and devastated by fire it lay before they left it!
There had been signs of treachery, even on the
road thither, work of the Cholulans; but, lodged
in the city, the Spaniards discovered, through the
agency of the intelligent Marina, a plot to annihilate
them later. Taking the Cholulans unawares
as they crowded the streets with&mdash;at the moment&mdash;harmless
curiosity, the Spaniards, with cannon,
musket and sabre, mowed down the unfortunate
and unprotected natives in one bloody massacre,
aided by the ferocious Tlascalans, who fell upon the
Cholulans from the rear. The appalling and unnecessary
slaughter at Cholula has called down
upon the heads of Cortes and the Spaniards the
execration of historians. Some have endeavoured
to excuse or palliate it, but it remains as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the indelible stains of the Spanish <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Conquistadores</i>
upon the history they were making. Having
accomplished this 'punitive' act, an image of the
Virgin was set up on the summit of the great
pyramidal temple, and some order restored. 'They
are now your Highness's faithful vassals,' wrote
Cortes to the King of Spain!</p>

<p>"After this the way seemed clear. Far on the
horizon loomed the white, snow-capped cones of
Popocateptl and Ixtaccihuatl, beautiful and pure
above the deserts, the canyons, and the forests
beneath them&mdash;the gateway to Mexico. From the
foremost, above its snow-cap, there belched forth a
great column of smoke, for at that period Popocateptl
was an active volcano. Onwards the
Spaniards pressed with buoyant hearts and eager
feet, and when they stood upon the summit of the
range their eyes beheld the beautiful valley of
Mexico, the haven for which they had long toiled
and fought, stretched below. There, shimmering
in distance, lay the strange, unknown city of the
Aztecs, like a gem upon the borders of its lakes:
its towers and buildings gleaming white in the
brilliant sun of the tropic upland beneath the azure
firmament and brought to deceptive nearness by
the clear atmosphere of that high environment.
There at last was their longed-for goal, the
mysterious Tenochtitlan."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The city of Mexico, notwithstanding its modern
attributes, is stamped with history and tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and in this respect is perhaps the most noteworthy
metropolis on the American continents. It is, as
it were, a mediaeval city, transplanted from the
Old World to the New. The United States has,
naturally, no place which may compare with it,
and in happier times Mexico City has been a tourist
centre for Americans, who, escaping from the more
materialistic and commercial atmosphere of their
own busy towns, and the extremes of heat or cold
which alternate therein, have sought the equable
and healthful condition of the Mexican upland
capital&mdash;an easy journey comparatively, of a few
days in a Pullman car, amid landscapes attractive
from their novelty.</p>

<p>We are in a city of churches and convents.
Elsewhere I have described some of these remarkable
edifices, home of the Roman Catholic faith,
and as we view the city from the pleasing hills
surrounding the valley their domes and towers
stand up refreshingly.</p>

<p>The houses of Mexico are of a type unknown
to the Anglo-Saxon American; the social customs,
the aspects of the streets, the markets, the flower-market,
the old, massive public buildings, the
cotton-clad Indian folk in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plazas</i> side by side
with beautifully dressed señoritas and correctly
attired, grave and ceremonious men&mdash;statesmen,
lawyers, doctors and men of many professions, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serenatas</i> or concerts in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">alamedas</i>, the lottery
ticket vendors thrusting their flimsy wares into
one's face, urging you to tempt fortune&mdash;for will
not the wheel be turned in the public square in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
half an hour, and may you yourself not be the
winner of the sorteo?&mdash;all these features catch the
traveller's eye as in the genial sunshine, before
the midday heat renders the shade of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> or
veranda advisable, we observe the life of the
Mexican city. In the market-place, at an early
hour or in the evening, the odour of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortilla</i>
or the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i>, fried in the open for ready sale,
will greet our nostrils, and there are piquant <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chiles</i>&mdash;a
favourite article of diet&mdash;and many luscious
and unknown fruits which we cannot resist.</p>

<p class="noind">Sentiment and love, indeed, play a strong part in
the temperament of this southern race, with all
its reserve and seclusion.</p>

<p>The foreigner in Mexico will thus find a varied
local colour in the Mexican capital and in other
cities throughout the Republic, such as could long
occupy his pen, and indeed his brush, if he wield
such. To come into actual touch with the people in
their homes is more difficult, but if he is fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
enough to be the guest in an upper class Mexican
family, he will experience the most pleasing hospitality.
To penetrate such circles, however, there
must be the appropriate qualities and circumstances.</p>

<p>In this peaceful city there are few signs of
revolution, disorder or bloodshed. The walls here
and there may be pitted with bullet-marks, but
the things which caused them come and go, and
the populace lives its life with merely passing notice
of them.</p>

<p>We may wander somewhat farther afield in the
valley: to the suburbs where the palaces of the
wealthy lie embowered in flowers and orange-trees;
to Xochimilco, the Field of Flowers; to
Chalpultepec&mdash;the Aztec "Hill of the Grasshoppers,"
where stands the presidential castle; to
the shrine of Guadalupe, the Lourdes of Mexico,
where the Virgin, it is said, appeared in a vision
to Juan, the poor Indian.</p>

<p>The great lake of Texcoco, a dreary body of
water now&mdash;it is partly drained by a great canal,
to the far greater salubrity of the place&mdash;formerly
extended to the city, which, indeed, at the time of
the Conquest, was built upon it and reached by
stone causeways&mdash;a position which might have
been impregnable.</p>

<p>The first attempt by Cortes and the Spaniards
upon Tenochtitlan ended in disaster. They were
enjoying the Aztec hospitality, which, however,
they outraged. They attacked and massacred a
number of the people and took Montezuma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a prisoner in the stout palace which had been
assigned as their quarters. They stormed and
carried the great <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Teocalli</i>, or pyramid-temple, and
threw down the great idol of the Mexicans.
Montezuma was killed, either by a missile from
without or treacherously by the Spaniards whilst
in their power. All seemed lost as a result of the
mad act of Alvarado in attacking the people. The
story of the disaster is a thrilling one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The bridges broken, the savages screaming
outside the walls, hope of victory gone, there was
now no counsel of war for the Spaniards save
that of escape. But how? At night and along
the great causeway was the only plan. A weird
scene it was on the beginning of that <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Noche Triste</i>&mdash;the
sorrowful night&mdash;which stands forth so
unforgettably in the history of the Conquest.
Disorder everywhere; piles of gold and valuables
on the floor, each Spaniard, whether cavalier or
boor, loading himself with what he thought he
could carry. 'Pocket what you can,' Cortes said,
'but recollect that gold is heavy and we have to
travel swiftly'&mdash;grave advice, the neglect of which
cost some their lives upon that awful night.</p>

<p>"And then began the retreat along the fatal
causeway. It was known that there were three
openings in this, and a portable bridge had been
made and was borne along to enable passage to
be effected. Hurrying on in the hope of passing
the breaches before alarm might be given, the
Spaniards entered upon the causeway and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
their portable bridge upon the first breach. Was
safety to be theirs? No! what was that appalling
sound, sonorous and melancholy, which rang over
the city and the waters amid the darkness? It
was the great drum on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocalli</i>; the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tambor</i>
of the war-god, sounded by vigilant priests, calling
the people to vengeance and battle. And in their
myriads the Aztecs poured forth and fell upon
the Christians, raining darts and stones upon them,
and making the night hideous with their war-cries.
Meanwhile Cortes and the advance guard had
passed over, and reached the second breach.
'Bring up the bridge!' was the repeated order,
as those behind crowded on. Useless; the bridge
was stuck fast in the first breach, wedged down
by the weight of guns and horses which had passed
over it, and as these dread tidings were heard the
mass of men upon the narrow causeway lost their
presence of mind. Those behind crowded on those
in front; men and horses rolled into the lake;
Spaniards and Tlascalans fell victims to the Aztecs,
who crowded the water in their canoes and leapt
upon the causeway; the shouts of vengeance and
triumph of the savages resounded all along the
dyke, silencing the muttered oath or prayer of
the Christians huddled at the breach. Down went
horse and man, artillery and treasure, until the
bodies of Christians and Indians and horses, and
bales of merchandise and chests of ammunition
the breach was almost filled, and a portion of the
fugitives passed over. And now the third breach
yawns before them&mdash;deep and wide. The morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
is dawning upon the fatal scene; the salt waters
of the lake have closed over many a gallant
Christian head; the frightful causeway is strewn
with wreck of man and merchandise. 'The rear
guard perishes!' and 'back and save them!' were
the words which rang out then, and Cortes and
his remaining cavaliers, who were in the lead, rode
back, even in that frightful hour&mdash;be it recorded
to their honour&mdash;and, swimming the breach once
more, strove to support their comrades. There
stood Alvarado unhorsed and battling, with the
savages pressing upon his rear. Escape there
seemed none. Canoes and spears teemed on every
side, and Cortes and his companions were forced
onward."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The figure of Alvarado stood up against the
grey sky alone&mdash;a moment&mdash;and then he
measured the breach with his eye. Planting his
lance on the wreckage in the waters of the breach,
after the manner of a leaping-pole, the heroic
Spaniard, collecting his energies, leapt forward,
and passed the chasm at a bound. The Aztecs
paused in admiration of this feat of the "Son
of the Sun," as they had named Alvarado, from
his fair hair and ruddy countenance. To-day we
may still see the place where this part of the causeway
lay, known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Puente de Alvarado</i>.</p>

<p>Away off the causeway into the grey dawn
passed the remnant of the routed Spanish Army,
wounded, bleeding, starving, their comrades gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
some to death, some to the dreadful sacrifices of
the Mexican priests, where their hearts would be
torn living from their breasts, and annihilation
threatening all. Baggage and artillery were gone,
not a carbine was left, and Cortes, seating himself
upon the steps of a ruined temple on the shore,
wept bitter tears of sorrow for the loss of his
comrades and his vanished fortunes.</p>

<p>So ended the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Noche Triste</i>, and to this day
may be seen an ancient tree under which it is
said Cortes wept.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, however, were not of such stuff
as easily gives in to difficulty and disaster. Had
it been otherwise, Mexico to-day might have
had a different destiny. It might have developed
a purely aboriginal or Indian state. But fate
seems not to have willed it that any such nation
should exist in the New World.</p>

<p>Cortes and the remnant of his army&mdash;there was
no other course for them&mdash;returned to their
Tlascalan allies, fighting their way even here, however,
for after passing the ancient pyramid of
Teotihuacan, even then standing ruined and
desolate a few miles north of the city&mdash;monument
of the shadowy Toltecs, who preceded the Aztec
hegemony, and which, restored by the Mexican
Government under President Diaz, is an object
of great interest to the traveller&mdash;they looked down
on the Plain of Otumba, and beheld the forces
of the Otomies drawn up in battle array against
them. These warriors wore armour of thick
quilted cotton, which formed a considerable protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
against the rude weapons of the country,
and the Spaniards were now without firearms.
They were so numerous that, it is recorded, the
plain "looked as if it were covered with snow,"
from the white armour.</p>

<p>But the Christians routed them, and thus the
Battle of Otumba was one of the turning-points in
New World history, as elsewhere remarked.</p>

<p>Reinforced by the Tlascalans, Cortes returned
to the siege of the city. Fresh supplies of arms
and ammunition had reached the Spaniards from
the coast, with horses and two hundred Spaniards
sent from Hispaniola. Cortes built a number of
brigantines, which were carried by the Indians to
the lake in order to attack Tenochtitlan by water
as well as land. But the whole enterprise would
have been hopeless had not the other Mexican
tribes, hating the Aztecs, joined forces with the
white men. The plan was to starve out the city
on the lake by laying waste the surroundings, for
it was dependent upon these for its food. To the
dead Montezuma's place had succeeded his nephew
Guahtemoc, a noble Aztec prince, animated by the
utmost spirit of patriotism in defending the heritage
of his forefathers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A series of severe struggles began then, both
by land and water&mdash;burning, slaughter and the
destruction of the lake towns. The Aztecs, with
their great number, raining darts and stones upon
the invaders at every engagement, attacked them
with unparalleled ferocity both by forces on shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and their canoes on the lake. The Spaniards took
heavy toll of the enemy at every turn, assisted by
their allies the Tlascalans, as savage and implacable
as the Aztecs, whom they attacked with a singular
and persistent spirit of hatred, the result of long
years of oppression by the dominant power of
Anahuac. Cortes, on every occasion when it
seemed that the last chance of success might attend
it, offered terms to the Aztec capital, by no means
dishonourable, assuring them their liberty and self-government
in return for allegiance to the Crown
of Spain and the renouncing of their abominable
system of sacrificial religion. These advances were
invariably met by the most implacable negatives.
The Aztecs, far from offering to yield, swore they
would sacrifice, when the day was theirs, every
Spaniard and Tlascalan on the bloody altars of
their gods; and as for entering into any treaty,
the last man, woman and child would resist the
hated invaders until the last drop of blood was
shed and the last stone of their city thrown down.
This vaunt, as regards the latter part, was almost
literally carried out, and to some extent as regards
the former.</p>

<p>"The siege operations were conducted vigorously
both by land and water. Again before the
eyes of the Spaniards stretched that fatal causeway&mdash;path
of death amid the salt waters of Texcoco
for so many of their brave comrades upon the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Noche Triste</i> of their terrible flight from Tenochtitlan.
And there loomed once more that
dreaded <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocalli</i>, whence the war-drum's mournful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
notes were heard. Guarded now by the capable
and persistent Guatemoc, the city refused an offer
of treaty, and invited the destruction which was
to fall upon it. From the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">azoteas</i>, or roofs of
their buildings and temples, the undaunted
Mexicans beheld the white-winged brigantines,
armed with those belching engines of thunder and
death whose sting they well knew: and saw the
ruthless hand of devastation laying waste their fair
towns of the lake shore, and cutting off their means
of life.</p>

<p>"But the Spaniards had yet to learn to their
cost the lengths of Aztec tenacity and ferocity. It
will be recollected that the city was connected
to the lake shores by means of four causeways,
built above the surface of the water; engineering
structures of stone and mortar and earth, which
had from the first aroused the admiration of the
Spaniards. These causeways, whilst they rendered
the city almost impregnable from attack, were a
source of weakness in the easy cutting-off of food
supplies, which they afforded to the enemy. A
simultaneous assault on all these approaches was
organized by the
Spaniards, under Sandoval,
Alvarado and Cortes himself, respectively, whilst
the brigantines, with their raking artillery, were to
support the attack by water, aided by the canoes
of the Tlascalan and Texcocan allies. A series of
attacks was made by this method, and at last the
various bodies of Spaniards advanced along the
causeways and gained the city walls. But frightful
disaster befel them. The comparative ease with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which they entered the city aroused Cortes's suspicions;
and at that moment, from the summit of
the great <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocalli</i>, rang out a fearful note&mdash;the
horn of Guatemoc, calling for vengeance and a
concerted attack. The notes of the horn struck
some ominous sense of chill in the Spaniards'
breasts, and the soldier-penman, Bernal Diaz, who
was fighting valiantly there, says that the noise
echoed and re-echoed, and rang in his ears
for days afterwards. The Spaniards, on this,
as on other occasions, had foolishly neglected
to secure the breaches in the causeways
as they passed, or at least the rash
Alvarado had not done so with his command, his
earlier lesson unheeded; and when the Christians
were hurled backwards&mdash;for their easy entrance
into the great square of the city had been in the
nature of a decoy&mdash;disaster befel them, which at
one moment seemed as if it would be a repetition
of that of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Noche Triste</i>. 'The moment I
reached that fearful bridge,' Cortes wrote in his
dispatches, 'I saw the Spaniards returning in full
flight.' Remaining to hold the breech if possible,
and cover the retreat, the chivalrous Cortes almost
lost his life from a furious attack by the barbarians
in their canoes, and was only saved by the devotion
of his own men and Indian allies, who gave their
lives in his rescue. Word, nevertheless, had gone
forth among the men that Cortes had fallen; and
the savages, throwing before the faces of Alvarado
and Sandoval the bloody heads of decapitated
Spaniards, cried tauntingly the name 'Malintzin,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which was that by which Cortes was known among
the Mexicans. Men and horses rolled into the
lake; dead bodies filled the breaches; the
Christians and their allies were beaten back, and
'as we were all wounded it was only the help
of God which saved us from destruction,' wrote
Bernal Diaz. Indeed, both Cortes and the
Spaniards only escaped, on these and other occasions,
from the Aztec's desire to take them alive
for sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Once more, after disastrous retreats and heavy
loss, the bleeding and discouraged Spaniards lay
in their camp, as evening fell. Of dead, wounded
and captured, the Spaniards missed more than a
hundred and twenty of their comrades, and the
Tlascalans a thousand, whilst valuable artillery,
guns and horses were lost. But listen! what
is that mournful, penetrating sound which smites
the Christians' ears? It is the war-god's drum,
and even from where the Spaniards stand there
is visible a procession ascending the steps of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocalli</i>, and, to their horror, the forms of their
lost comrades are seen within it: whose hearts
are doomed to be torn out living from their breasts
to smoke before the shrine of Huitzilopochtli, the
war-devil of their enemies. From that high and
fearful place their comrades' eyes must be gazing
with despairing look towards the impotent Spanish
camp, glazing soon in death as the obsidian knives
of the priests performed their fiendish work. The
disastrous situation of the Spaniards was made
worse by the desertion, at this juncture, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Tlascalan and other allies. Awed by a prophecy
sent out confidently by the Aztec priests, that both
Christians and allies should be delivered into their
hands before eight days had passed (prophecy
or doom, which the priests said, was from the
mouth of the war-god, appeased by the late
victory), the superstitious Indians of Cortes's
forces sneaked off in the night.</p>

<p>"Continued reverses, in the face of long-continued
action and desire for the attaining a given
end, forges in the finer calibre of mind a spirit
of unremitting purpose. Blow after blow, which
would turn away the ordinary individual from his
endeavour, serves to steel the real hero to a dispassionate
and persistent patience, and the purpose
from its very intensity becomes almost a sacred
cause, and seems to obtain from the unseen powers
of circumstance success at last. So with Cortes
and others of the Spaniards. The period prescribed
by the somewhat rash prophecy of the
Aztec priests and their infernal oracle having
passed without anything remarkable having taken
place, the Tlascalan and Texcocan allies, upbraided
and warned by the Spaniards' messengers, now
sneaked back to resume the attack against the
city. The Aztecs had sought to cause disaffection
in outlying places by sending round the bloody
heads of decapitated Spaniards and horses, but
with little effect. Cortes then prepared for a
final effort. The plan adopted was to be
slower but surer than the former one of simple
slaughter. It was determined to raze the city to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the ground; to destroy the buildings step by step,
fill up the canals, and so lay waste the whole area
from the outside, so that unobstructed advance
might be maintained.</p>

<p>"The execution of this plan was begun. The
city ends of the causeways were captured and
held; street after street was demolished, and canal
after canal filled up amid scenes of incessant fighting
and slaughter. Day after day the Spaniards
returned to their work; day after day with
admirable tenacity the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan
disputed the ground inch by inch, watered with
the blood of themselves, their women and their
children. Their supplies cut off, famine and
pestilence wrought more terrible havoc among
them&mdash;crowded as they gradually became into one
quarter of the city&mdash;than the arms of the Spaniards
and the Tlascalans. At the termination of each
day's work the Spanish prepared an ambuscade
for the enemy, drawing them on by seeming to
retire, and massacring them with the artillery and
gun-fire and lances, to say nothing of the weapons
of their savage allies. On one of these occasions
'the enemy rushed out yelling as if they had
gained the greatest victory in the world,' Cortes
wrote in his dispatches, and 'more than five
hundred, all of the bravest and principal men, were
killed in this ambush.' He added, and it was a
common occurrence, 'our allies'&mdash;the Indians&mdash;'supped
well that night, cutting up and eating
their captives!' During the days of this terrible
siege the famous catapult was made, an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
engine to discharge great stones upon
the enemy. This was to enable the Spaniards to
husband their powder, which was getting low, and
the Aztecs watched the construction of this
machine with certain fear. It was completed and
set to work, but the builder, a Spanish soldier of
inventive faculty, nearly played the part of the
engineer hoist with his own petard, for the great
stone fired rose, it is true, but went straight
up and descended again upon the machine,
which was ever afterwards the laughing-stock of
the army.</p>

<p>"Further severe losses were now inflicted upon
the beleaguered inhabitants, as more ammunition
had been obtained. Peace had again been offered
by the Spaniards, and again refused by the Aztecs.
An Aztec chief of high rank had been captured,
and then returned to Guatemoc as a peace envoy.
The Mexicans' reply was to execute and sacrifice
the unfortunate emissary, and then collecting their
forces they poured out upon the causeways like a
furious tide, which seemed as if it would sweep
all before it. But the Spaniards were prepared.
The narrow causeways were commanded by the
artillery, which poured such a deadly hail upon
the enemy's numbers that they returned fleeing
to the city.</p>

<p>"And soon the end approaches. The division
led by Cortes made a fierce assault; and whilst
the battle raged the Spaniards observed that the
summit of one of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teocallis</i> was in flames. It
was the work of Alvarado's men, who had penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
already to the plaza. Forces were joined,
and the inhabitants of the city, driven into one
quarter thereof, still made their stubborn and&mdash;now&mdash;suicidal
stand. For the streets were piled
up with corpses, the Aztecs refraining from
throwing the bodies of their slain into the lake,
or outside the city, in order not to show their weakness.
Pestilence and famine had made terrible
inroads upon the population. Miserable wretches,
men, women and children, were encountered
Wandering about careless of the enemy, only bent
upon finding some roots, bark or offal which might
appease the hunger at their vitals. The salt waters
of the lake, which they had been obliged to drink,
for the Spaniards had cut the aqueduct which
brought the fresh water from Chapultepec, had
caused many to sicken and die. Mothers had
devoured their dead children; the bodies of the
slain had been eaten, and the bark gnawed from
the trunks of trees. In their dire extremity some
of the chiefs of the beleaguered city called Cortes
to the barricade. He went, trusting that capitulation
was at hand, for, as both he and his historians
record, the slaughter was far from their choosing.
'Do but finish your work quickly,' was the burden
of their parley. 'Let us go and rest in the heaven
of our war-god; we are weary of life and suffering.
How is it that you, a son of the Sun, tarry
so long in finishing, when the Sun himself makes
circuit of the earth in a day, and so accomplishes
his work speedily?'</p>

<p>"This remarkable appeal struck renewed pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to the heart of Cortes, and once more he begged
them to surrender and avoid further suffering, and
the Spaniards drew off their forces for a space.
But the inexorable Guatemoc, although he sent
an embassy to say he would hold parley, and the
Spaniards waited for him, did not fulfil the promise
at the last moment. Incensed at this behaviour,
the Spaniards and the Tlascalans renewed the
attack with overpowering energy on the one part
and barbaric savagery on the other. Contrary to
the orders of the Spaniards, their savage allies
gave no quarter, but murdered men, women and
children in fiendish exultation. The stench of the
dead in the beleaguered city was overpowering;
the soil was soaked with blood; the gutters ran
as in a rain-storm, say the chroniclers, and, wrote
Cortes to the King of Spain: 'Such slaughter
was done that day on land and water that killed
and prisoners numbered forty thousand; and such
were the shrieks and weeping of women and
children that there were none of us whose hearts
did not break.' He adds that it was impossible
to contain the savage killing and torturing by their
allies the Tlascalans, who practised such cruelty
as had never been seen, and 'out of all order
of nature.'</p>

<p>"At nightfall the attacking forces drew off,
leaving the remainder of the inhabitants of the
stricken city to consider their position. It is stated
that the Tlascalans made a great banquet of the
flesh of the fallen Aztecs, and that on this and
other occasions they fished up the bloated bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of their enemies from the lake and devoured them!
At sunrise on the following day Cortes and a few
followers entered the city, hoping to have a
supplication for terms from Guatemoc. The army
was stationed outside the walls, ready, in the event
of a refusal&mdash;the signal of which should be a
musket-shot&mdash;to pour in and strike the final blow.
A parley was entered into as before, which lasted
several hours. 'Do you surrender?' Cortes demanded.
The final reply of Guatemoc was, 'I
will not come: I prefer to die where I am: do
your worst.'</p>

<p>"A musket-shot rang out upon the air; the
Spaniards and their allies fell on to merciless
slaughter: cannons, muskets, arrows, slings, lances&mdash;all
told their tale upon the huddled mass of
panic-stricken people, who, after presenting a
feeble and momentary front, poured forth upon
the fatal causeways to escape. Drowned and
suffocated in the waters of the lake, mowed down
by the fire from the brigantines, and butchered
by the brutal Tlascalans, women, children and
men struggled and shrieked among that frightful
carnage; upon which it were almost impious to
dwell further. Guatemoc, with his wife and
children, strove to escape, and the canoe containing
them was already out upon the lake, when a
brigantine ran it down and captured him. All
resistance was at an end. No sign of life or
authority remained among the ruined walls; the
fair city by the lake was broken and tenantless,
its idols fallen, and its people fled. The Homeric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
struggle was over; the conquest of Mexico was
accomplished."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under the long rule of the viceroys that
followed the Conquest, Mexico lived her life in
a mediaeval but often peaceful and not unhappy
state, and had Spain but understood her and developed
the resources of the land and protected
her simple Indian folk instead of exploiting them,
and at the same time antagonizing the colonists,
there is no reason why a magnificent and permanent
Spanish empire should not have grown to
being.</p>

<p>We have remarked elsewhere on the abundant
mineral wealth of the country. The great silver
deposits of Guanajuato were discovered as a result
of a camp-fire made on the rocks by some muleteers,
who found refined silver among the ashes,
which the heat had smelted from them. The great
"mother lode" here yielded up enormous wealth.
The pleasing city of Zacatecas to-day grew from
another discovery of silver ores, which produced
a value, up to the middle of last century, of nearly
eight hundred million dollars. The curious
archives of these mines, which still exist, show how
carefully the Spaniards worked them. The
Pachuca mines, which to-day are still worked,
yielded similar wealth, and it was here that the
well-known <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> or amalgamation process was
discovered, with quicksilver from Peru.</p>

<p>There are other centres, scarcely less important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
well known to the mineralogist. The mineral-bearing
zone of Mexico is sixteen hundred miles
long, and yields nearly all the metals known to
commerce. Coal, however, is not a frequent
product. The country has been described as a
paradise for the prospector. The mines are innumerable:
almost every hill is pierced or perforated
by shafts and galleries, ancient or modern;
some are enormous tunnels, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">socavones</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The Mexican native miner is, in his way, expert
and active, and with rude appliances performs
marvels in the work of ore extraction. Halt a
moment by yonder pit in the rocky slope. Look
down: a notched pole descends, upon which you
would hesitate to venture, giving access to the
workings beneath. Yet, in a moment, perhaps,
a peon, bearing on his back an enormous load of
rock in a hide or sack, will ascend from the bowels
of the earth, panting and groaning&mdash;we shall hear
the noise of his breathing before we see him.
He will cast his load at our feet, and from it will
roll the gleaming quartz and pyrites, with perhaps
the red of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rosicler</i>, or rich oxide ore of silver,
or the yellow ochres of the decomposed gold-bearing
sulphides, more readily prepared by Nature
for treatment and winning of the yellow metal.
Or he may bear it to the stream-bed, there to
treat it in some primitive stone mill.</p>

<p>Otherwise we may visit huge modern mills
where hundreds of stamps are clanging and
engines are winding and furnaces are burning, for
a host of these exist throughout the land, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
disorder and revolution may have suspended
their operations.</p>

<p>Many curious products of the vegetable world
attract our eyes. Behold yonder stupendous
cactus-trees&mdash;the organo cactus, whose symmetrical
spiny branches like a giant candelabrum, weighing
perhaps tons, with their mass of sappy foliage,
arise from a single stem, which could be brought
down by a stroke of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i>, or wood-knife&mdash;that
formidable implement or weapon
(made perhaps in Birmingham) which the
Mexican peon loves to wield or use. Look at
the marvellous giant leaves of the juicy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maguey</i>,
or agave, as long as a man, and see the peon insert
his siphon to the heart of the plant to draw forth
its sap, which he blows into the goatskin on his
back, and from which he will presently make his
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i>. This plant, the great American aloe,
comes into flower and dies in a few years. It
exhausts itself in flowering. In England we call
it the century plant, for the exotic lingers long in
the unfavourable climate, and with difficulty puts
forth its blossoms at all. There, too, are hedges
and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">circas</i> of prickly-pear, or nopal, which yield
the delicious wild fig&mdash;the cactus familiar to the
traveller in the Holy Land and Syria, whence it
was taken from Mexico.</p>

<p>In the coastal lands, as before remarked, the
feathery coconut-palm waves over the villages,
and the elegant leaves of the banana form refreshing
groves, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cacao</i> yields its stores of chocolate.
Lovers of this sweetmeat might hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
name of Mexico in gratitude indeed, for is not
the very name and product of Aztec origin&mdash;the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chocolatl</i> of the early folk here? In the tropic
forests and plantations the beautiful rubber, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Castilloa elastica</i>-tree, rears its stately foliage, and
here, again, are we not indebted to Mexico?
Remember it, ye lovers of lawn tennis. For when
the early Spaniards arrived they found the
Mexicans playing tennis, with balls of rubber, in
those curious courts whose ruins still remain in
the jungles of Yucatan.</p>

<p>Again, yonder flies the wild turkey. Was he
not the progenitor of that noble bird which comes
upon our Christmas tables? Here, too, is the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">zenzontl</i>; or mocking-bird, and a host of gorgeous
winged creatures besides.</p>

<p>Through many a desert range and over many
a chain of hills, violet in the distance, alluring and
remote; past many a sacred well or hill marked
by a cross, hard by the paths worn by the generations
of bare or sandalled feet we may pass;
and here, perchance, by some spring stands a
startled native maid, her <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla</i>, or great water-pitcher,
on her shoulder&mdash;stands in classic but unwitting
pose. Or through the heat a mounted vaquero
rides upon his attenuated mule or horse&mdash;for the
equine race works hard and eats little here, but
bit, spur and the bridle are his till the day he
leaves his bones upon the trail&mdash;and, "Buenos
dias, señor," with doffed hat the horseman gives
us as he passes, with ever-ready Mexican courtesy
to the foreigner; or he did so until of recent times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
when, for reasons we need not here dilate upon,
the foreigner has come to be regarded with anything
but friendship.</p>

<p>There was always a charm about this old land
of Mexico; there still is, despite its recent
turbulent history. Small wonder that foreigners
in increasing numbers loved to make their life
in its quaint towns, to take up land and industry
within it.</p>

<p>Of these towns we cannot speak here; Guadalajara,
Puebla, Oaxaca and many another invite us
to their pleasing streets and ancient buildings.
From the Atlantic to the Pacific, from north to
south, they are dispersed over the wide area of the
Republic.</p>

<p>The southern, or rather easternmost States of
Mexico are, as regards their landscape and life,
often of peculiar interest, mainly by reason of the
more tropical surroundings and the large rivers,
such as those that flow into the Gulf of Campeche,
in Vera Cruz and Tabasco.</p>

<p>Typical of these rivers are the Grijalva and
the Usumacinta. In places lined by dark forests,
the banks elsewhere open out to permit of plantations
of bananas, tobacco, maize, pineapples, rubber
and so forth, and an occasional village, its white
walls gleaming among the foliage, the roofs
thatched with palm, gives the human touch
thereto.</p>

<p>Ascending the river in a slow stern-wheel
steamer, we remark an occasional canoe, laden
with skins and other produce, or moored inshore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
whilst its occupants are fishing in the plentifully
stocked waters. There are great trees festooned
with masses of moss and with trailing lianas, where
monkeys play by day and from whence at night
their howling falls on the ear. The white
heron and aigret, whose snowy plumage is so
valuable an article of commerce, startled by the
passage of the boat, sail gracefully away to the
bends of the river, and flocks of parrots, similarly
disturbed, scream their defiance, whilst wild ducks
and cranes and birds of the brightest plumage
are in sight at every moment. The alligators,
large and small, that throng the shoals project
their grotesque forms into the water, offering a
mark to the gun of the idle huntsman.</p>

<p>In the flower world Nature is often gorgeously
arrayed here. Pure white lilies lie at the base
of flowering trees that rise in a mass of bloom
for forty feet or more, of a profusion and beauty
almost inconceivable. The queen of the banks,
the stately coco-palm, carries its load of nuts,
waiting for nothing but the gatherer of a harvest
provided by Nature. Here, too, is the cinchona-tree,
with its bright, smooth red trunk and
branches and rich green leaves, offering its virtues
of quinine bark. The arnica plant, with its daisy-like
yellow flowers, and the morning glory of rich
and brilliant hue abound, and the orchids&mdash;"not
the dwarfed product of a northern hothouse, but
huge, entrancing, of the richest browns, the
tenderest greens, the most vivid reds and the
softest yellow, sometimes as many as half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
upon one tree"&mdash;decorate the decayed trunks
of the trees. There are, too, natural plantations
of wild pineapples, and many fruits
besides.</p>

<p>A good deal of land in these regions is capable
of cultivation, and, extremely fertile, yields profitable
returns. But means of transport are, of
course, defective, although the rivers offer long
lines of communication. The Indians do not love
work, except inasmuch as such may fill their own
small requirements, for in so bountiful a region
Nature supplies them with many things necessary
for life, which a very few hours' labour will supplement
for a whole year. There is rivalry between
the established planters for the available labour,
and peonage is largely carried out.</p>

<p>In Yucatan, the labour system upon the plantations
of the Mexican millionaire hemp-growers of
the peninsula has been described as little more
than slavery by some writers. But great wealth
and some measure of progress have resulted from
this special Yucatan industry, and Merida, the
capital city, shows these elements in marked
degree.</p>

<p>The Yucatan peninsula is a curious limestone
plain, originally covered, and still covered in great
part, with tropical jungle, riverless, but with underground
streams. The water was used by the
ancient builders of the Maya cities here, whose
beautifully sculptured palaces and pyramid temples
are among the chief archæological wonders of
Spanish America. They constructed wells adjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to the buildings&mdash;the curious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cenotes</i>, or
sacred wells.</p>

<p>The lore of these silent, buried temples, over-run
by the jungle, the haunt now of wild creatures,
is fascinating in its mystery. Some observers have
likened their details of the façades of these structures
to Hindu temples, others to Egyptian, and so forth,
whilst others stoutly proclaim them to be of purely
autochthonous culture.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This culture area, we have
already seen, extended into Guatemala.</p>

<p>To turn for a moment now to the Pacific coast
of Mexico, this presents its own special points
of interest. From hence may have come the
Toltecs originally, with their wonderful native
knowledge and stone-shaping arts, among famous
objects of whose handiwork is the famous
Calendar Stone, to be seen in the Museum of
Mexico. This remarkable stone shows the early
Mexicans to have had a more exact division and
calculation of solar time than their contemporaries,
the cultured nations of Europe. However, the
principal Toltec remains are not upon the Pacific
coast, but at Tula, on the Plateau, which appears
to have been their ancient capital.</p>

<p>Upon the long Pacific coastline Mexico possesses
several important seaports, to some of which
access may be gained by railway, and many
picturesque places rarely heard of by the outside
world, together with vast areas of fruitful land
and valuable forests. This littoral, indeed; forms
a region which must some day take its place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the economy of the globe. The long peninsula
of Lower California, forming an isolated part of
Mexico, is in many respects remarkable, and into
the head of the Gulf flows the Colorado River,
with many peculiar characteristics.</p>

<p>What we have here said as to the topography
of Mexico, with its beautiful mountains, rivers,
archæological remains, cities and so forth, is little
more than an index to a vast field of interest,
which, however, must be studied elsewhere. We
are now bidden to cast a further glance at the
people who have their being upon the diversified
surface of the Republic.</p>

<p>A small proportion only of the Mexicans are
white&mdash;perhaps ten per cent. The remainder are
of varying shades of brown. But there is no
"colour line," although, naturally, the purest
European blood is found among the upper and
governing classes.</p>

<p>However, the brown race has produced some
of the best of Mexico's people. The famous
Juarez, the lawyer-president who preceded Diaz,
and who was responsible for some of the most
important measures of reform, was a pure Indian
by birth, and Diaz himself was proud of his partly
aboriginal ancestry. In fact, it cannot be said
that there is any dividing line in the composition
of the Mexicans. The bulk of the people are
thus of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizo</i> or mixed race, but there are
various districts where only pure Indians
are found.</p>

<p>The working population of the country, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
three-quarters of the total, are peones. Peonage is
a state of what might be termed debt-bondage.
They dwell upon the great landed estates, dependent
for their livelihood upon the owners of
these, unable to leave them, and are paid their
small wage largely in goods under a species of
"truck system." They are often purposely kept
in debt. Their economic condition is a low one.
They own nothing of the land upon which they
dwell; they carry on occupations which are not
profitable to themselves, and are subjected to
many abuses in this respect; they dwell in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adobe</i>,
or dried mud huts, generally of the poorest kind;
their food is of the most primitive, and often scanty&mdash;meat
is an article which rarely enters into their
diet; if a cow dies on the plain they cut it up
for food&mdash;but nevertheless they labour hard from
sunrise to sunset upon a diet of maize and beans.
This class is almost wholly illiterate, although there
has been some improvement of late years in this
respect.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 453px;"><a name="village" id="village"></a>
<img src="images/illus-140a.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="village" />
<div class="caption"><p>VILLAGE ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE, MEXICO.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not to be supposed that this numerous
class is an unworthy one. On the contrary, the
Mexican peon is industrious, faithful, courteous,
and deeply religious&mdash;religion, however, greatly
mixed with superstitions. As an agriculturist he
does not lack capabilities, and as a miner the
Mexican, as we have seen, is an excellent workman
in many respects.</p>

<p>In brief, the working class of Mexico is the
most important and homogeneous body of brown
labour in the world. The European or American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
mine or plantation manager (who was until
recently plentifully established in the country)
may often express very diverse views in this connexion,
but from a more detached point of view
the above characterization is true.</p>

<p>As for the working class Mexican woman, she
has many good qualities, and is often of pleasing
appearance, whilst among some of the Indian tribes
the girls are handsome.</p>

<p>The upper class Mexican is generally well
educated, often having been sent to Europe or
the United States for his education. He has the
pleasing courtesy of the Spanish race, and is
frequently a well-informed man of the world.
However, it cannot be said that education in the
United States is necessarily an improvement.
There is something about the association which
is not pleasing. He becomes too "smart" and
cynical.</p>

<p>The educated Mexican class earnestly lays
claim to a "high civilization," and art, science
and literature are, at least in theory, greatly
esteemed. There may be, in some respects, an
element of superficiality about this refinement, and
about life in general, with this class. But to a
large extent it has its foundation in reality, and
the educated Mexican and the upper class man
of business has nothing to lose in point of culture
in comparison with, for example, the American
or other foreign business man. Indeed, it is the
latter that would often suffer by comparison in
this respect, especially the American.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mexican is much less dominated by the
money-getting spirit than is the man of the United
States, and has, perhaps, a wider vision, both in
domestic and international affairs. The upper
class Mexican woman is justly noted for her
beauty and vivacity, and becomes a devoted wife
and mother. She is extremely religious. Indeed,
the influence of the Church and the priest enter
too strongly into the life of the female population
of Mexico. The upper class man has often
thrown off religion and is acquiring an easy
materialism.</p>

<p>With a people of the above described characteristics,
it might well be asked from what source
does the revolutionary element and bloodthirsty
soldiery come? From what class do the ambitious
"generals," the would-be presidents, the ruthless
guerilla bands spring, whose doings have shocked
the civilized world? They do not come from the
ordinary class of educated Mexicans, who are
peaceful estate owners, lawyers, business men, and
so forth, who, in general, would be very loath
to risk their persons or property in the hazards of
revolution. As to the young man of this class,
he generally loves the ease and luxury of city life
too much to adventure himself far from his often
effiminate pleasures. Nor do they come from the
great peon class, which, so far, has asked little
more than to pursue its normal life, varied by
the not infrequent carousals of feast-days, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pelea de gallos</i>, or cock-fight, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">corrida de
toros</i>, or bull-fight, as his Sunday diversions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to drown his sorrows in draughts of intoxicating
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque or aguardiente</i>.</p>

<p>The revolutionary element is, in fact, drawn
from a comparatively small class of ambitious or
disappointed politicians and the idle or dissatisfied
military element, in the main. It cannot
of course be denied that revolution at times springs
to being under patriotic or national motives, to
remedy the abuses laid on the country by dishonest
or oppressive rulers. In reality, disorder
is generally the result of a mixture of both these
elements. A revolutionary standard having been
raised, and a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pronunciamiento</i> made, there are
rarely lacking followers. The latent martial spirit
of the Mexican&mdash;a heritage from both his Aztec
and Spanish forbears&mdash;breaks out. The prospect
of place and office attracts the educated malcontent,
of booty and licence the lower element, and of
higher pay and free food the peon. Political
murders and ruthless cruelty attend these operations,
and a whole nation is terrorized and its
ordinary affairs brought almost to a standstill
thereby. Often, however, the revolution is little
more than a local affair, and is put down or dies
out, although it may have damaged the country's
reputation abroad in a measure far exceeding its
real importance.</p>

<p>Is there any remedy for this perennial turmoil,
and if so, what is the remedy? The reply is that
whilst the present economic conditions of Mexico
exist, stability will never be reached. A small
upper class practically monopolizes the wealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
education, land and opportunity of the Republic&mdash;a
republic in little more than name. The main
bulk of the people, as has been shown, are poor,
landless and illiterate, and in consequence easily
throw off their settled habits at the bidding of
upstart leaders. They have little to lose and
perhaps&mdash;they think&mdash;the possibility of gain by
disorder.</p>

<p>The steadying element of a settled middle class
grows very slowly to being in Mexico. Industry
is in its infancy. Little is manufactured in the
country, except cotton, textiles, and even here
the wage of the operative is exceedingly low. Such
manufacturing industry is mainly represented by
the well-advanced cotton and textile factories of
Puebla and elsewhere, works of much importance,
generally actuated by water-power plant. This
is a highly profitable industry for the mill-owners,
who reap dividends often of thirty per cent.
Manufacturing industry here, as in the other Latin
American Republics, is accompanied in its growth
by the rise of the strike habit, which is rapidly
increasing. Jealousy of the foreign concessionaire&mdash;who
flourished so markedly under the Diaz
regimen&mdash;is a further element in disorder. The
advancement of the masses has been extremely
slow. A new spirit is needful if progress is to be
made, a recognition of the rights of the Mexican
"democracy," a better co-ordination of the
national resources and a constructive and equitable
economic policy, added to disinterested political
leadership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Mexico in reality offers conditions for prosperous
and enlightened life. Its natural resources
are varied, abundant and well distributed. The
country does not, like some other Latin American
States, draw revenue from any great or special
article of export (sooner or later the economic
defect of a land), but can be more or less
self-contained and self-supplying. Innumerable
pleasing towns and picturesque villages are
scattered over its surface, which normally are
centres of peaceful life, and the population is
well distributed. There is much of beauty in
the architecture of these towns, and of refinement
and dignity among the people&mdash;elements largely,
a heritage of Spanish rule, added to the native
disposition.</p>

<p>The nation is not yet over-commercialized or
vulgarized, and if political and economic stability
can grow to being without becoming so, Mexico
might build up for itself a pleasing and durable
civilization, and become a permanent leader among
the republics of the New World.</p>

<p>The traveller who has sojourned in this picturesque
and romantic land, who has experienced
its pleasing hospitality and has understood the
character of its people, cannot but hope that such
future awaits it. In the coming settlement of the
world Mexico has a good deal to offer, but trading
must be accompanied in the future by statesmanship,
here as elsewhere. Mexico, indeed, is a subject
for a science of constructive economic
biology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of Mexico after Independence shows
how resolutely the Mexicans threw off the method
of governance by Royalty, but it is a question
whether there might not have been a more sustained
and orderly development under that
system.</p>

<p>At this time, Mexico was the third largest
empire in the world, and included a large part
of what is now the Western United States, such
as California and Texas and the adjoining territories,
as well as Guatemala. She began her independent
history with an emperor&mdash;Iturbide, who
patriotically wished to strive against the "Holy
Alliance" which schemed to bring about the re-domination
of Spain, but he was executed by
Mexicans, and fell, serene, and disdainful of his
ungrateful compatriots.</p>

<p>The ill-fated figure of Maximilian stands out
in picturesque silhouette in Mexican history, well-meaning
but weak; as does the pathetic story of
the Empress Carlota, and her appeal to Napoleon
against his perhaps perfidious withdrawal of
French troops from Mexico. Maximilian was
"executed" at Queretaro. Two faithful Mexican
officers shared his fate&mdash;Miramon and Mejia.
"Take you the place of honour in the centre,"
said the ill-fated Hapsburg prince in turn to each
of them, as facing the file of soldiers they awaited
the volley. But each declined, the carbines rang
out, and so passed the dream of empire in Mexico.
An Austrian warship arrived to take his body;
the commander asking for the remains of "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Emperor of Mexico." But he was informed that
"no such person had existed," although the body
of "Maximilian of Austria" was delivered to him.
In the Museum of Mexico to-day, all that remains
is his gilded coach and some other trappings.</p>

<p>The dream of empire in Mexico was largely
due to the Napoleon of the times, and was mainly
frustrated by the action of the United States and
the Monroe Doctrine. Imperial government was,
however, supported by a very large party of upper
class Mexicans.</p>

<p>The Mexicans, rightly or wrongly, have retained
to this day a certain animosity against the United
States by reason of the loss of their huge northern
territory of Texas, in what they called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">la guerra
injusta</i>, the "unjust war," in which they declared
that American machinations were displayed in
order to deprive them of the land. One phase of
this history was in the filling up of Texas, in part,
by American filibusters, and in the upholding of
slavery there by the American Government, the
Mexicans having made a decree forbidding slavery;
and this must be recorded to the credit of Mexico.
Black slavery there brought a dreadful fruit, and
even in recent&mdash;and present&mdash;times race riots, including
the burning alive of negroes, have been a
result.</p>

<p>However, this is past history, and these territories
developed under American rule in a way
that would not have been possible under the
Mexicans. To-day we hear of constant antagonism
across the border. It is urged by some that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
United States might enter and control Mexico,
but it is to be hoped that Washington is wiser
than to embark upon such an adventure. It might
be a difficult and bloody undertaking, and, even
if successful militarily, would but perpetuate race-hatred
in the New World. The Mexicans, a people
of nearly twenty millions strong, must work out
their own destiny. The history of Mexico shows
the evils of forced and unnatural episodes
and conditions, and this would but add to the
series.</p>

<p>Many a battle has been fought between
Americans and Mexicans since the first conflict
in 1846, and both nations have had occasion to
test each other's bravery and capacity in war.
The Mexicans excel in guerilla warfare, and are
splendid horsemen, but the more solid tactics of
the Americans generally prevailed. Mexico was
invaded more than once by United States forces,
and, indeed, occupied. The storming of Chapultepec
Castle, near the city of Mexico, was one
of the heroic engagements, when a young Mexican,
rather than see his country's flag fall into the hands
of the&mdash;to them&mdash;"hated Yanquis," wrapped it
round his body and leapt from the turret, to be
dashed to pieces on the stones below.</p>

<p>All students of American matters will look for
that time when these two countries will dwell in
amicable relationship, such as seemed, in the time
of Diaz, to have been reached, but in which, in
reality, jealousy and rancour were but thinly veiled.
There is really nothing fundamental between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
two people against amicable relations and co-operation
in those matters of mutual interest on
their continent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus we leave this interesting land of Mexico,
to make our way into another region, no less
attractive, in its own particular field.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST</h3>

<h4>IN COLOMBIA, ECUADOR AND PERU</h4>


<p>An enormous horizon opens to the traveller who
essays the voyage along the Pacific coast of South
America, from Panama perhaps to the extremity
of the continent; a voyage through every range of
climate, from the Equator to the frigid south, past
verdant tropic shores or barren desert, or beneath
eternal snowfields; a voyage redolent of the early
heroic history of the New World, with, to-day, a
setting of the picturesque modern life of the old
viceregal, one-time colonies of Spain.</p>

<p>We shall touch at innumerable seaports, the outlet
of five different countries; those of Colombia
and Ecuador, of Peru, Bolivia and Chile. From
Panama to Cape Horn this vast trajectory of some
five thousand miles may be roughly divided into
six parts of eight hundred miles each; that is,
Panama to Guayaquil, thence to Callao, thence
to Iquique, thence to Valparaiso, with the remainder
along the southern coast of Chile: a
voyage equal approximately to one from Liverpool
to New York and back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Due to the comparative tranquillity of the ocean,
the voyage is made in steamers of coasting type,
in which the state-rooms are all upon the deck, and
open directly therefrom, a pleasing arrangement in
comparison with the stuffy hold of trans-Atlantic
or trans-Pacific vessels.</p>

<p>Behold, then, a sterile coastline, beaten by
never-ending surf, broken by rocky promontories,
bird-covered perhaps, and seal-haunted, whence
the distant roar of breaking rollers at times comes
seaward, and, inland, a rising, undulating zone of
desert and cañon, brown or tawny or purple in
its shadows, stretching away mysteriously for perhaps
a hundred miles to where it meets the solemn
Cordillera, which, grey, faint and serrated, with
no form save that of outline&mdash;the true test of distance&mdash;forms
our horizon on the east.</p>

<p>Above is a deep blue sky, but inclining to greens
and opals, for, in the west, with banners of gold
and crimson vapours&mdash;the colours of Spain, whose
mariners first beheld it here, the sun is setting, its
disc already upon the bosom of the Pacific. The
sun-god of the Incas goes down, and rose-tinted
rays shoot across the stark and rugged littoral and
touch the edges of the green, refreshing seas, rising
between the steamer and the distant surf. It is
the coast of Peru, and in this romantic hour of
sunset yonder deserts might be peopled with the
spectral forms of mail-clad Spaniards, the gaunt
Pizarro at their head, heedless of all save empire
and El Dorado.</p>

<p>But not a sail or hull disputes possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the fast-darkening sea, with the quivering steamer
upon whose deck we stand, cleaving its way a
thousand miles from Panama; and if ghosts
there be, why not one of a caravel of Drake,
hot on the Plate ships' track from Callao? Nor
on the seaboard does a single habitation denote
the presence of man, for we are passing one of
those stretches of desert of which this coast is
largely composed.</p>

<p>But let us look more closely, and imagine we
behold for a moment the forms of the intrepid
white men who first broke in upon this desolation.</p>

<p>It is the early part of the sixteenth century.
Upon the seashore there is a band of mail-clad
Spaniards, at their head a tall bearded man, spare
of frame, but full of spirit, that spirit which dares
the unknown and dares again, in spite of famine
and privation. It is Pizarro, the famous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistador</i>,
and in his hand is a drawn sword.
There has been disaffection in the band, wrought
of sufferings and disappointment in that desolate
region. "Where is the gold we have been
promised?" the malcontents exclaim. "What
profit is there in fighting famine and miserable
savages? Let us go back to Panama before we
all perish!"</p>

<p>For reply Pizarro drew the point of his sword
across the sand. "Comrades," he said, "on the
south of this line lie perhaps hardship and death;
on the north salvation and ease. Yet perhaps on
the south is Peru and untold wealth; on the north
Panama and poverty. Choose you which you will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
I go south. Who follows?" And thus speaking,
he stepped across the line.</p>

<p>Twelve faithful spirits followed this action, and,
later, the thirteen received special reward from the
Spanish Sovereign.</p>

<p>Others arrived from Panama, and the voyage
was continued. Among the band was a valiant
Greek of great stature, Pedro de Candia, and he,
on one occasion, contemplating from the ship a
distant fertile valley, went ashore alone to traverse
it. "Resolved I am," he said, "to explore yonder
valley or die," and, bearing a great wooden cross
in one hand, and his sword and carbine, he broke
in upon the astonished Indians, returning unharmed
with tales of gardens filled with artificial flowers of
gold, and other wonders. This was at Tumbez.</p>

<p>But the conquest of Peru was not thus easily to
be performed. The Spaniards' resources were
limited, and they returned to Panama. But a few
gold and silver toys and some Indian sheep&mdash;the
llamas&mdash;which they took back, did not greatly
impress the unimaginative Governor of that colony,
and Pizarro was obliged to proceed to Spain, where
he made a good impression at Court. His further
expedition was, however, rendered possible mainly
by the Queen&mdash;a woman again furnishing the imagination
and means to discover the New World!
She it was who rewarded Pizarro and his twelve
faithful companions, in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">capitulacion</i> she caused
to be drawn up.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>Pizarro and his men returned to brave the hardships
of the coast again, but we must leave this
interesting history and turn to our topography.</p>

<p>The conditions of aridity on this coast, upon
which rain never or scarcely ever falls, is a result
of the interception by the Andes of the trade
winds, whose moisture is deposited on the summits,
and of the cool Peruvian or Humboldt current,
flowing northwards up the coast, its lower temperature
preventing the evaporation of the sea and
discharge of the moisture as rain.</p>

<p>We shall have noted this peculiar change to
aridity soon after passing the Equator, as before
remarked. The shores of the Gulf of Guayaquil
and part of the Ecuadorian coast are vividly green
from the dense mangrove thickets and other vegetation,
but as soon as the mist zone of the Equator
is left behind the coastal zone becomes stark and
unfruitful, beaten by tearing surges between the
few havens.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Panama and its famous Canal&mdash;whose
great works rapidly fade into the haze of
distant shore and mountain, reminding us how
small the greatest human mark on the face of
Nature really is&mdash;we have passed the Pacific coast
of Colombia, which does not present any very noteworthy
features. It is shut off from the interior
by the high mountains, and is often unhealthy
and but thinly populated, notwithstanding that it
affords certain resources and potentialities that in
the future should be valuable. At the principal
port of Buenaventura it is unlikely that our steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
will call. The settled and prosperous Colombia&mdash;the
old viceregal colony of New Granada&mdash;lies in
the highlands, whose means of access are from
beyond the Isthmus of Panama, upon the "Spanish
Main," as we shall see elsewhere. However,
Buenaventura is the port for the beautiful Cauca
Valley, the garden vale of Colombia, with its pleasing
town of Cali, and a line of railway has painfully
made its way up this steep littoral thereto.
Buenaventura was reached by the first Spaniard
to sail this sea, Andagoya, who named it the Port
of Good Fortune, but the great prize of discovery
lay in Peru, which he did not reach: the prize
which fell to the more fortunate and adventurous
Pizarro. The port has been described as perhaps
the most beautiful on the Pacific coast, but the
traveller who desires in addition material comforts
will not prolong his stay thereat.</p>

<p>Our vessel, pursuing its way, will shortly have
sighted the coast of Ecuador, and may, if conditions
concerning quarantine be favourable, have
to enter the great indentation which forms the Gulf
of Guayaquil.</p>

<p>The Guayas River, with the Island of Puna at
its mouth, is of considerable width, but narrows
as the ocean steamer ascends it so much that
passage at times is difficult. Memories of Pizarro
centre about the island.</p>

<p>The seaport of Guayaquil lies over thirty miles
upstream, and its aspect on approaching is a striking
one; its buildings clustered along the water-front,
backed by verdure-clad hills, and the shipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in the harbour, and, at night, the rows of
lights of the streets, give an impression of considerable
importance to this tropical seaport. The
river off Guayaquil has been likened to the Mississippi
at New Orleans. In early times the town
was frequently sacked by buccaneers&mdash;French,
English and others, among them the ubiquitous
Dampier. Its dreadful reputation for malaria and
yellow-fever has caused travellers to shun the place,
but these matters have experienced some improvement
of recent years, especially since the building
of the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>As the steamer lies in the stream, enterprising
Indian boatmen bring off certain native wares for
sale to the passengers, among them the famous
"Panama" hats&mdash;which are, be it noted, not a
product of Panama, but of the coastal district north
of Guayaquil, notably Jipijapa and Monte Cristi.
They are also made in Colombia. Great industry,
patience and knowledge are displayed by the
Indians in making these hats, of which the material
is a palm fibre, not a straw or grass. They are
a really beautiful and dexterous example of native
industry.</p>

<p>Upon the Manabi coast, in the same region, we
may see some remarkable vestiges of the ancient
folk of Ecuador, in the great carved stone armchairs
or seats ranged upon a flat hill-top. These
seats are unique in early American archæology and
form a puzzle to the antiquarian.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Six hundred miles to the west, far out of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
track here, lie the Galapagos Islands, a possession
of Ecuador, the home of the monstrous turtles
whose name the archipelago bears.</p>

<p>The Guayas River and its affluents command our
attention and interest by reason both of their
beauty and economic importance. They form the
only considerable fluvial system on the whole
western coast of South America, where, in general,
the streams are of small volume and unnavigable.
Here we may navigate the river and its arms for
two hundred miles, and our vessel will convey us
past many a flourishing hacienda on the banks,
where the famous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cacao</i> of Ecuador is grown&mdash;the
chocolate of commerce, of which the region produces,
or has been accustomed to produce, a third
of the world's supply. This fertility is due to the
nature of the alluvial soil, which for ages has collected
in what are locally termed <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bancos</i>; areas or
deposits specially suitable for the cultivation of
the cocoa-trees. Many such haciendas flourish
upon these rivers, and are sources of much wealth
to their proprietors and to the nation. The alluvial
mud of such remarkable fertilizing properties is
carried along by the waters, which have deposited
it in these favoured spots upon the network of
streams which fall into the Guayas.</p>

<p>Groups of feathery coco-palms, with their slender
columns and graceful foliage, which flourish around
the haciendas, form a pleasing picture, which serves
to offset the somewhat monotonous appearance of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sabanas</i>, or barer stretches of flat land which
we overlook from the steamer's deck, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
alternate with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cacaotales</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cafetales</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cañaverales</i>,
as the coco and coffee plantations and the
great cane brakes&mdash;of monstrous bamboos, which
are a valuable article of construction&mdash;are termed.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>We remark here the curious native rafts, which
without other agency than the current ascend and
descend the rivers on the flowing and the ebbing
tide, reaching Guayaquil, and returning thence
upstream.</p>

<p>Continuing our voyage along the coast, the eye
may fall upon the white guano-covered headlands,
and the attention is suddenly arrested by what
appears at first sight to be a low dark cloud
moving on the face of the waters. It approaches,
and we see that it is not a cloud, but a flight of
birds, innumerable, and flying in close formation&mdash;at
times, indeed, they obscure the sky. These are
the guano-producing birds, which haunt the rocky
headlands and islets, and whose product has been
so considerable a source of wealth and contention
on this coast. Guano was used by the Incas in
their intelligent and painstaking agricultural operations,
and its misuse or monopoly was prohibited.</p>

<p>The Incas, vestiges of whose remarkable
structures and curious customs we find scattered
in profusion throughout the enormous territory&mdash;perhaps
two thousand miles in length&mdash;which
formed their empire, upon whose coast we are
journeying here, made little use of the sea, except
for fishing. By relays of posts, of Indian runners,
fish was carried in fresh, across the deserts and
over the Cordillera, for the table of the Inca at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Cuzco, which town, the ancient Mecca and capital
of the early Peruvians, is situated in a valley
11,500 feet above sea-level and over two hundred
miles inland&mdash;a remarkable performance.</p>

<p>The Incas were not a seafaring people, and their
civilization&mdash;for it fully merits the name of such&mdash;was
indeed cut off from the rest of the world both
by the ocean and by the enormous rugged chains
of the Andes, and by the impenetrable forests of
the Amazon basin on the east. As far as is known,
they appear not to have had knowledge even of
the contemporaneous cultures of the Mayas, the
Aztecs, and the Toltecs of Mexico and Central
America, although all these early American cultures
may have had a common origin, in times
much nearer the general childhood of the world.</p>

<p>Was this coast first explored and even settled
by the Chinese long before Columbus sailed?
There are reasons for thinking this may have
been so.</p>

<p>The exploits of Pizarro and his followers took
place in the neighbourhood of Tumbez, near the
westernmost point of the South American Continent.
How, fighting against famine, they made
their way along this stark and inhospitable littoral
and ascended the Andes, where by a combination
of intrepidity and treachery they overcame the
reigning Inca chief and his people, forms one of
the most fascinating episodes of early American
history.</p>

<p>To-day, when we leave our comfortable steamer
and follow those same paths, we find little alteration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in many respects, after the lapse of four
centuries. We must journey in the saddle over
the roughest and often most dangerous of
mountain trails. At night it may be that an indifferent
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fonda</i>, or inn, in the poor Indian villages
on the road will afford some hospitality, but this
will be of the meanest description. Railways are
few and far between along this immense and
little-travelled seaboard; food is scarce and life
primitive.</p>

<p>But the stamp of Spain is over all, and there is
an atmosphere&mdash;attenuated it may be&mdash;of the
times of Don Quijote de la Mancha in its social
regimen. We cannot withhold a tribute to Spain,
in remarking how she stamped, for all time, her
own characteristic culture throughout thousands of
miles, east, north and south, of tropic seaboard
and rugged Cordillera, upon this great continent.</p>

<p>But "Spanish gentlemen should not soil their
hands in trade" ran a decree of the old "Laws
of the Indies," and the Spaniards, except for their
exploitation of the rich gold, silver and quicksilver
mines (at a terrible toll of Indian lives),
did not reap much commercial profit from their
possessions. This great mineral wealth was poured
for centuries into the needy coffers of Spain&mdash;poured
as into a sieve, for it was largely squandered.
Under the viceroys the mines were
worked with feverish activity. In one instance
an urgent mandate for increased production so
worked upon the official in charge of one of
the huge mines, those of Huancavelica, in yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
mountains&mdash;a veritable labyrinth of underground
galleries and chambers, among which was a
chapel, deep below the surface, with candles ever
burning before its shrines&mdash;that he ordered the
supporting columns of ore to be taken out, with
a result that the mine fell in, entombing five
hundred miners, whose bones remain in the ruin
to this day, it is said.</p>

<p>As for commerce, the British are the great
Ph&oelig;nicians on this coast; transporting cargo
hither and bearing it hence. The German activity
became marked before the war, but the <i>Kosmos</i>
line of steamers stopped, and the Teutonic bagsman
ceased his assiduous traverse of the interior
villages with his wares.</p>

<p>Mining in Peru is not what it was in the time
of Spain. A wealthy company of United States
capitalists, it is true, ships great quantities of
copper from the wonderful deposits of Cerro de
Pasco, 15,000 feet above sea-level, and there are
many smaller concerns of varied nationalities. But
thousands of irregular subterranean workings all
over the vast Cordillera remain waterlogged and
abandoned&mdash;mines where the visitor is told of fabulous
wealth extracted, and which still contain untold
riches, awaiting the time when they shall be called
upon to surrender their hidden stocks of gold and
silver, of copper and a host of other minerals.
The glories of Potosi have in large measure
departed, but the tin mines of Bolivia yield
annually a large proportion of the world's supply
of that metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Enormous coalfields&mdash;notwithstanding that South
America has been regarded as a coal-less continent&mdash;exist
in the Andes, their upturned strata
outcropping in the bleakest regions, in some cases
amid the perpetual snow.</p>

<p>To-day the cultivators of sugar and cotton in
the irrigated valleys of this vast littoral have come
into their kingdom, reaping, during the war,
fortunes from the shipment of these commodities
to Britain; their only plaint that of the restriction
of carriage. The merchant and the shopkeeper
made the same lament, and the fashionable and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">simpatica</i> dames of Latin American Society bewailed
the impossibility of their enjoyment of the
latest Parisian modes.</p>

<p>Away on the slopes and tablelands of the grim
Cordillera the ancient palaces and temples of the
bygone Incas look down, unknown, unvisited, save
by those whom interest or chance may take that
way. Once washed by the waves of Lake Titicaca&mdash;that
most remarkable of lakes, 12,500 feet above
the sea, yet whereon we may journey out of sight
of land&mdash;lie the ruins of that strange temple of
Tiahuanako, of unknown age, the most ancient
handiwork of man in the New World.</p>

<p>To-day, all that remains of that epoch are these
old stone structures, save that the Indian, as
evening falls, preserving some sentiment of an
ancient state, climbs the lonely hills, and there,
alone, makes mournful music with his flute of
reeds: notes which fall weirdly upon the ear as
we pass beneath, across the wide plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The empire of the Incas lay principally in
Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, and extended to the
northern part of Chile, but the Incas did not
overcome the Araucanian Indians&mdash;fierce and intractable&mdash;who
dwelt in Chile. Nor did they,
apparently, descend very much beyond the eastern
slopes of the Andes, into the forests and plains
of the Amazon and of the Plate, though there
are some vestiges of their occupation there. They
established a line of forts, of blocks of squared
stone along the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ceja</i>, or edge, of the Montaña,
some of which we may see to-day, doubtless to
ward off the attacks of the forest savages.</p>

<p>The Incas possessed great stores of gold, which
they used to make household vessels for the princes
and for religious purposes, and the Spaniards
possessed themselves of this gold. Much of it
was sent down to the coast for shipment to Spain,
to fill the needy coffers of the Spanish sovereigns.
Some of it fell into the clutches of Drake and
other enterprising adventurers into these realms of
gold, who disputed the Spanish monopoly of the
New World.</p>

<p>Let us imagine, as we pace the deck of the
steamer and look over towards the setting sun,
touching the bosom of the broad Pacific, an early
scene upon these waters. Here is Drake's ship,
<i>Golden Hind</i> or <i>Pelican</i>, blowing out of Callao
with every stitch of canvas set. Drake has heard
that a Plate ship, laden with gold and silver, has
just set sail for Panama, and he is chagrined
at having missed it. The Spaniards had feared no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
danger. As far as they had known there were
no craft in these waters save those which flew the
colours of Spain. But now the viceroy of Lima,
Don Francisco de Toledo, is uneasy. The, to
him, unspeakable Drake&mdash;"<i>Caramba!</i> Draco, a
Dragon"&mdash;is about!</p>

<p>The English ship overhauls the plate ship.
But the wind drops and she is still hull down,
many a mile of heaving sea between. Shall
they lose the prize? No; the boats are put out,
and for three days the men of Devon towed their
vessel, straining at their oars as British seamen will,
and the sluggish Plate ship rises more upon their
horizon. Away they toil, past the river of
Guayaquil, above which the gleaming Chimborazo
rears his distant head, until, six hundred miles to
spare from the haven of Panama, she is overtaken,
off Cape San Francisco, in what is now Ecuador.
They board the ship and seize the treasure, which,
according to the Spanish chroniclers, amounted to
nearly a million pounds sterling.</p>

<p>The viceroy did not altogether lose hope of
recovering this treasure. He prepared a veritable
hornets' nest for Drake, in the form of an armada,
which was ordered to wait at the Strait of
Magellan, which, he imagined, Drake must pass
in order to get home. But Drake was not thus
to be entrapped. He sailed on northwards&mdash;trying
for a strait eastward through America&mdash;reaching
the spot known now as Drake's Bay, in California;
found, of course, no passage; careened his ship,
cleaned it, and turning his prow westward, sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
across the Pacific, going completely round the
world for England, where he was worthily knighted
by Queen Elizabeth on the quarter-deck of his
wave-worn ship.</p>

<p>Guayaquil is the gateway to ancient Quito, in
the Cordillera, and between that port and Callao
is Salaverry with the quaint and busy Peruvian
town of Trujillo, founded by Pizarro. Callao,
to-day, is the principal seaport upon this vast coast,
between Panama and Valparaiso. The Oroya railway
running therefrom takes us up to the summit
of the Andes, nearly 16,000 feet above sea-level,
first passing through the old viceregal capital, and
ascending the valley of the Rimac, whose waters,
the whispering oracle of the Incas, gave their name
to Lima.</p>

<p>Lima, the old <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ciudad de los Reyes</i>, or "city of
the kings," as Pizarro, its founder, termed it, in
honour of his Spanish sovereigns, surrounded by
its cultivated lands, irrigated from the Rimac, must
be regarded as one of the premier cities of the
Spanish American world, and one of the most
quaint and pleasing, with many historical and
literary attributes, a legacy of the old viceregal
times. A handsome cathedral overlooks the
broad, well-planted plaza, and its high towers,
rebuilt after the disastrous earthquake of 1746,
a sketch of whose terrors I have given later
on, dominate the green <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">campiña</i>, or countryside.</p>

<p>It is a city of many churches and other ecclesiastical
buildings, and has something of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
mediaeval atmosphere we have remarked in the
city of Mexico, and some of its public buildings
are worthy of note. The gloomy structure which
held the Inquisition faces upon a small plaza in
the midst of which arises a bronze equestrian figure
of Bolivar, a replica of that at Caracas. We
remark the carved oak balconies to certain of the
ancient houses, former residences of viceroys and
nobles.</p>

<p>But Lima does not love to live upon its past.
Its people have laid out a magnificent <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Paseo</i>,
or promenade, named after Columbus, and here
a gay and fashionable throng parades upon the
Sabbath day, or in the evenings, listening to the
music of the band amid the palms and flowers.
Here congregate the wealth and beauty of the
city, its statesmen and leaders, and all those who
customarily throng to these earthly paradises which
the Spanish Americans customarily lay out as
adjuncts of their cities. The latest modes are
seen, the fashions of Paris and London&mdash;also the
half-naked Indian, unlettered and unashamed.</p>

<p>Lima possesses many educational and scientific
bodies and establishments, and has a well-deserved
claim to being a centre of culture. Its Press is
one of the best in South America: its people have
strong poetical leanings and administrative genius.
Among the more recent of successful presidents
stand forth the names of Pardo, Pierola, and
Leguia. The last-named, a capable administrator,
lived in London during the Great War and went
through the experience of air-bombardment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
when he returned to Peru to take up his second
term of office.</p>

<p>There is a certain isolation about Lima, due
to its geographical position. The other large
towns of the Republic are separated from it by
vast stretches of desert and Cordillera, and the
railways give access to but a few points, whilst
any interruption of the steamer lines along the
coast cuts it off from the outside world. However,
its picturesque watering-places and well-built
residential suburbs extend the amenities of
Lima over a wider zone.</p>

<p>The upper-class folk of Peru, as we behold
them in their capital and other large towns, have
the pleasing traits of courtesy and hospitality we
are accustomed to associate with their race in
marked degree. They are extremely eloquent,
and aim at a high standard of civilization&mdash;that
sensitive characteristic of the Spanish American.
Their women have justly earned a world-wide
reputation for their beauty and vivacity, their
good breeding and culture, as well as their piety
and high standard of family life. If the hand of
semi-mediaeval custom still hampers Peru in its
social customs, this is a matter which time
constantly modifies.</p>

<p>All parts of Spain furnished the ancestors of
the Peruvians&mdash;Basque, Catalonian, Andalusian,
Galician, and Castillian names being encountered
among them, and in viceregal days there were
many titles of nobility, which fell into disuse on
the advent of the Republic. Nevertheless, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
an amiable weakness of the Peruvians&mdash;as it is
of many other Latin American folk&mdash;to love titles,
as we see by the so frequent use of the doctorate
degree. In a Peruvian Cabinet, it would be rare
to discover a minister who is not addressed as
"Doctor"&mdash;of laws or science&mdash;for the degree is
often taken in Latin America largely as conferring
some social distinction, and not necessarily with the
purpose of practising this or that profession. Yet
in justice to the Peruvians it must be said that
they are clever professional men, whether at law,
medicine or other, whilst practical science has its
outlet also in the engineering profession, a considerable
number of whose exponents make a study of
the country's agricultural and mineral potentialities.</p>

<p>A pleasing feature of the Peruvians is their
cordial welcome of foreigners, their desire to
assimilate the things of the outside world, and
strong notions of progress. It is not, however,
to be supposed that their houses are readily open
to the foreign visitor. Like all Latin Americans
they are exclusive; and the traveller must be a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</i>, a person of refinement, if he is to enter
their family circle.</p>

<p>The main defect of the country and its governing
classes is the neglect of the vast Indian
and lower-class population, for this upper and
enlightened class is but a small proportion of the
population. The oligarchical tendencies which we
find so strongly marked in Chile, in Mexico, and,
indeed, in every Latin American State, are strong
in Peru. These countries can never truly progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
until they take their domestic responsibilities
more seriously, thereby improving the economic
and social status of the great bulk of poor folk
whom Providence has delivered to their charge.
On the contrary, they are more and more exposed
to uprising and anarchy, such as that so terribly
exemplified in Mexico, and farther afield in Russia.
If they would preserve their culture they must
extend it. It is true that these responsibilities
concerning the Cholos and Indians have of recent
years been more widely recognized, but much
remains to be done in the field of practice. Elsewhere
I venture to discuss, in the closing
chapters of this book, what would appear to be
the lines upon which the solution of this vital
question of Spanish America should proceed.</p>

<p>Peru is not yet freed from the revolutionary habit,
the game of politics which brings unrest and at
times destruction. The sweets of office are always
alluring. The game is generally played in Peru
by but a few, the bulk of the people standing
aloof. Its incidents are often extremely picturesque
and at times operatic. A president may, one day,
be in the zenith of his power, surrounded by his
admirers and fellow-administrators. The next,
arrested by a rival with a handful of soldiers, he
may find himself on board a steamer for Panama,
deported, banished and alone. This method is
at least better than that which at earlier times
involved political murders, some of which stand
forth in the republican history of Peru.</p>

<p>In justice, however, it must be said that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
stains on the pages of the past are not more
marked in Peru than in the case of some of her
neighbours in the New World. Moreover, it is
useless for the European to pretend to arraign
the Spanish American for these practices, whilst
his own house is, or has so recently been, the
scene of such dreadful disorders.</p>

<p>From the disorders of man here on the great
Pacific coast, let us turn to the unrest of Nature.
During our stay in Lima we may have experienced
an earthquake shock, slight or considerable, and
with others have hastily left our dwelling. Upon
this coast the scourge of the earthquake and the
tidal wave is at times laid heavy upon the dwellers.
The destruction of Valparaiso is but a recent
occurrence, as was that of San Francisco, in
California. To-morrow, these or any other cities
along the unstable edge of this hemisphere might
be brought low from the same cause.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of terror from the middle of
the eighteenth century. It was in Lima, the
beautiful capital of Peru, when, on a summer night
in October 1746, the folk of the city were leaving
the temples after celebrating the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fiestas</i> of Saint
Simon and Saint Jude. Rich and noble personages,
escorted by their slaves, were exchanging,
as was customary, friendly visits. The moon shone
brilliantly from a cloudless sky; all was quiet and
peaceful: the twang of a guitar or other evening
whispers of the city alone broke the serenity. The
bells of the convents and the church-tower clocks
struck half-past ten. It was bedtime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a terrific shaking of the earth took
place; the foundations of the world seemed
loosened, the people were thrown from their beds;
the towers of the churches fell; the walls and
roofs of the houses crashed in; the most dreadful
panic reigned as thousands of persons were
smothered in living tombs. It was an earthquake.</p>

<p>The shock lasted three minutes, during which
the earth was wrenched and torn as if by a giant.
In the time it takes to tell the city was destroyed,
and the work of over two hundred years brought
to ruin. Of a city with 60,000 souls, not more
than twenty-five houses remained. Of the two
great towers of the cathedral, one fell upon the
domed roof and the other on the belfry, destroying
the temple in great part&mdash;so chronicled a
Jesuit priest who witnessed it. Five magnificent
churches were laid in ruins, with sixty convents,
chapels and monasteries. The great buildings fell
upon the small&mdash;all were demolished. The streets
were blocked with wreckage: the inhabitants, in
all states of dress and undress, striving to flee, were
crushed by falling walls. Sweet maidens of Lima,
old hags from the back streets, noble and priest,
gallant and beggar, all in their terror jostled each
other. Those engaged in illicit amours confessed
their sins to unheeding ears. The viceroy's palace
fell; the triumphal arch with the equestrian statue
of Philip V fell; the Royal University and colleges
fell; the Tribunal of the Inquisition was reduced
to fragments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lima at this time Catholicism was in the
zenith of its power and splendour and the faith
of the people strongest. But no one dare approach
the churches, notwithstanding that they were the
home of God. The shocks continued&mdash;more than
two hundred in twenty-four hours&mdash;and went on
for three days. Trenches were opened to bury
the dead. The stench of the dead bodies of
mules smothered in their stables was unbearable.
Over six thousand persons perished.</p>

<p>Whilst the stricken people were seeking their
lost relatives, another terror was visited upon
them. Suddenly, from Callao appeared a negro
on horseback, his eyes starting from their sockets,
shouting in accents of terror: "Save yourselves!
the sea is coming sweeping in over the coast!
It will be upon you!"</p>

<p>Lima is but a few miles from Callao, with a
strip of coastal land between. The earthquake
had given rise, as it commonly does on that coast,
to a tidal-wave, which was now rushing inland.
It did not, however, reach Lima, falling some
distance short, and, it is said, rising to 150 feet
above sea-level. But the people already seemed
to see themselves overwhelmed. A priest, half
naked, wounding his own breast in penitential
frenzy, rushed through the streets, ashes on his
head, the bit and bridle of a mule in his mouth.
"This is the punishment of heaven upon sinners!"
he cried, and he beat himself with an iron bar
until the blood gushed from his body. At the
sight, thousands of persons fell on their knees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
imploring pardon from heaven, confessing their
crimes, but "as all were sinners, none lent ear
to the confession of others, being too much
occupied in recounting their own misdeeds."</p>

<p>In Callao a more dreadful scene was enacted.
After the first great shock of the earthquake, the
people tried to flee from the town, but the gates
had been locked for the night, and whilst they
flocked the streets, screaming and praying, endeavouring
to avoid the falling walls, a terrible
thing was seen. The sea had gone out for more
than two miles from the shore, forming mountains
of water that seemed to reach the skies. The
mountains of water then rushed forward and fell
with horrid crash upon the doomed city, submerging
the ships in the bay or carrying them
in among the houses. The cries for mercy to
heaven were vain: there was no mercy shown
them, and the people perished. When at length
the waters retired, nothing was left of Callao but
part of the wall and the two great doors of
the city.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>To this day the image of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Nuestra Señora de los
Temblores</i>&mdash;Our Lady of the Earthquakes&mdash;is
carried through the streets of Lima, as of other
Peruvian towns, such as Arequipa, which has
suffered terribly from earthquakes in its history,
whenever the earth trembles, that the heavens may
be appeased.</p>

<p>A moral effect of these visitations is to be
noted by the traveller in Peru. It is seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the women of the labouring class wear very long
skirts that often drag in the mud or dust. It
was ordained that, the formerly short skirts being
immodest and displeasing to heaven, which, it was
held, had punished the people by that earthquake,
they should henceforth be worn long enough to
conceal the ankles!</p>

<p>Perhaps the devotees of exaggerated feminine
fashion in Europe to-day might usefully ponder
these occurrences!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST</h3>

<h4>IN PERU, BOLIVIA AND CHILE</h4>


<p>Our course still lies southward. The steamer,
at times approaching sufficiently near the coast or
calling at the small seaports to set down passengers
or to embark merchandise&mdash;of ores, cotton,
sugar, cattle and so forth&mdash;permits glimpses of
the littoral, the long stretches of desert alternating
with fruitful vales, irrigated by the rivers descending
from the Cordillera. Here and there the
curious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">médanos</i>, or moving sand-dunes, arrest the
eye;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> here and there are olive-groves and vineyards
and other cultivation of Southern Peru,
where excellent wines are produced. Soon we
shall pass the Chilean frontier, and away in the
interior lies Bolivia, among the distant Andes,
whose grey and solemn wall looks down eternally
upon the seaboard.</p>

<p>Let us ascend from the coast by one of the railways
here, that running from the Peruvian port of
Mollendo, an exceedingly bad and exposed roadstead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in which, at times, it is difficult to gain the
shore at all from the heavy surf.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="cultivated" id="cultivated"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CULTIVATED LANDS ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF PERU.</p>

<p class="sig">
Vol. I. To face p. 176.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Southern Railway, ascending the dreadful
volcanic wastes, and barren, rocky spurs which
mark this region, reaches the pleasing city of
Arequipa, lying at nearly 8,000 feet elevation. It
stands at the foot of the Misti, a high, snow-covered
volcano, whose conical form reveals its
geological structure, a prominent landmark in this
part of Peru, seen far over the surrounding deserts.
The tonic breezes and blue sky give to Arequipa
an invigorating environment. The cathedral, a
handsome structure, and the houses, are built of
volcanic freestone, which gives an air of solidity
and repose to the place.</p>

<p>In including Arequipa in our survey of the coast
we shall be consulting the wishes of the people of
the city, who prefer to consider themselves as of
the coastal region&mdash;with all that such a position
conveys&mdash;for the coast represents a more advanced
culture here, as contrasted with the <i>Sierra</i>, or
Cordillera.</p>

<p>The fortunate traveller will retain pleasing impressions
of Arequipa and its society&mdash;its</p>

<p class="center">
Bright skies and brighter eyes.
</p>

<p>The railway, leaving Arequipa, passes the main
range of the Cordillera at an elevation of nearly
15,000 feet, and descends to Lake Titicaca, whence
fresh-water navigation on this high inland sea
carries the traveller into Bolivia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Lake Titicaca is perhaps the most remarkable
lake in the world. A body of fresh water,
12,500 feet above the sea, and two hundred miles
long, upon which we navigate out of sight of land,
is perhaps unique. From the steamer the imposing
range of the White Cordillera of Bolivia
is seen, the snow-covered Andes, from Sorata to
Illimani, whose crests or peaks rise to over
20,000 feet. We remark the craft of the natives,
the curious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balsas</i> of woven grass, sometimes with
mat sails, in which they navigate the lake. Titicaca
is peculiar in being a hydrographic entity,
having no outlet except that the water flows for
a few miles along a channel to the adjacent Lake
Poopo. Fed by the melting snow of the Andes,
the waters are kept down solely by the agency
of evaporation and some possible seepage.</p>

<p>Beyond these high lake basins and the mountain
crests to the east stretch the illimitable forests
of the Amazon, partly unexplored, a lure to the
traveller.</p>

<p>But we must return to the seaboard. We
have already remarked that Bolivia possesses
no ports. She is isolated from the coast,
having lost the port of Antofagasta in the Nitrate
War of last century.</p>

<p>In passing, it might be remarked that the comity
of the South American nations on the coast might
be consolidated if this seaport could be restored
to Bolivia. Nothing in the future is likely to
cause more enmity than the arbitrary cutting-off
of peoples by adjoining nations from access to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
seas and navigable rivers, whether in America or
Europe. The nitrate region, which was the scene
of the bloody struggle between Peru and Chile,
and in which Bolivia took part, stretches like a
veritable Sahara upon the littoral here, south of
Tacna and Arica. These two last-named provinces
were, students of South American polity will
recollect, possessions of Peru, and are now held
by Chile. They are still the cause of bitter controversy
between the two nations, which periodically
threatens to bring about war between them.
It is greatly to be lamented that this fruitful source
of contention cannot now be settled, and an era of
neighbourly feeling brought about, instead of the
hypocritical diplomatic expediency and veiled hatred
which do duty for international relations on this
coast. The matter might well be made the subject
of arbitration, with friendly nations (perhaps
Britain or the United States) as umpires.</p>

<p>The sun-baked rocks and sands of this part of
South America have been stained with the blood
of thousands of Chileans and Peruvians, and the
same events might occur again. Yet both these
nations have more territory than they can efficiently
develop.</p>

<p>But the Spanish American people have ever
much difficulty in settling their quarrels. Their
traits of pride and over-individualism, inherited
from the Spaniard, render it difficult to give way.
If one performs an act of magnanimity, the other
may suspect or accuse it of weakness or cowardice.
Both wrap themselves in haughty reserve, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
invoke the high gods to bear witness to their own
truth, both are quixotic and quick-tempered. Yet
they are people of the same civilization, speech,
laws, literature and culture, with splendid qualities
and a promising future, and if these quarrels could
be composed, the progress of the region would
be hastened.</p>

<p>The port of Iquique (with Pisagua), south of
Arica, is well known to many travellers and other
persons interested in the Chilean nitrate fields, of
which it is the principal shipping centre.</p>

<p>The greater share of the business of nitrate
production is in British hands. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">oficinas</i>
are establishments peculiar to Northern Chile,
forming small colonies or localities, whose workers
consist of the Chilean <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rotos</i>&mdash;a hardy and turbulent
but industrious folk&mdash;headed by English
managerial staffs.</p>

<p>Around these centres of industry, on every hand,
broken here and there by small oases where water-springs
occur, stretches some of the most dreadful
desert land in the world. Such, for example, are
the desert of Tarapaca, and those intervening
between the nitrate pampas and the Cordillera,
where neither man nor animal can live, nor blade
of herbage can flourish. Nature here, as far as
the organic world is concerned, is dead, or has
never lived.</p>

<p>Iquique is a town of wooden houses, overlooked
by sand-dunes that threaten it from the wind-swept
desert, but it has pleasing features, and the
English colony here, with its well-known club&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
has a reputation for hospitality, and, incidentally,
the consumption of cocktails&mdash;has its own marked
characteristics. The Nitrate Railway ascends
through high, broken country to the east to the
Pampa. Indeed, the life and thought of the region
is largely embodied in the words "Nitrate" and
"Pampa."</p>

<p>The deposits of this mineral are unique in
geology. There is none other of the same nature
on the globe. The mineral lies in horizontal beds
a few feet beneath the surface. We may be riding
over the flat, absolutely barren <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pampa</i>, or plain,
floored with nothing but fragments of clinkstone,
eroded by the ever-drifting sand and unrestful
wind, gleaming in the metallic sunlight, for no
shower of rain ever visits this wilderness, a place
where we might think Nature has nothing to offer
of use or profit. But we should be mistaken. An
excavation will reveal the sheet of white salts
beneath, deposited in geological ages past by
marine or lake action, under conditions not clearly
understood&mdash;deposits which cover many miles of
territory. The material is blasted out in open
mining and conveyed to the oficinas&mdash;large
establishments of elaborate machinery and appliances&mdash;where
it is boiled, refined, re-crystallized
and thence shipped for export.</p>

<p>Still farther afield through the deserts here are
vast areas of salt, the ground presenting the
appearance of a suddenly arrested, billowy sea, over
which the horseman makes his way like a lost
spirit in Hades. Upon the horizon are the steely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Andes, upon whose plateaux here, reached by the
highest railway in the world, we find rich copper
mines, such as those of Colhuahuassi, and various
deposits of the salts of copper.</p>

<p>But to return to the coast. It was upon this
melancholy seaboard, the coast of Tarapacá, that
a sea-fight, classic in the annals of South America,
and indeed one of the very earliest of battles
between ironclad ships, took place&mdash;an engagement
which has rendered the names of Pratt and Grau,
the Chilean and the Peruvian admirals, immortal
in the memory of their respective countrymen.</p>

<p>Peru and Chile were engaged in life and death
struggle with each other on land and sea. Iquique,
then a Peruvian port, was blockaded by Chile.
Grau, having sailed from Callao for Arica with the
<i>Huascar</i> and <i>Independencia</i>, which vessels practically
constituted the Peruvian Navy, heard of the
blockade, and proceeded to Iquique to engage the
enemy. The day was breaking as the Peruvian
vessels arrived off the port. The approach was
seen by the <i>Esmeralda</i> and the <i>Covadonga</i>, two
Chilean ships, and Captain Pratt, on board the
<i>Esmeralda</i>, decided to give battle, notwithstanding
that the Peruvian vessels were ironclads, whilst
his own commands were unarmoured. It was a
brave resolution, but the Chileans were born sea-fighters.</p>

<p>The <i>Huascar</i> was a turret-ship, built at
Birkenhead in 1866, but of only 1,130 tons,
armed with Whitworth and Armstrong guns, but
with armour-plating incapable of resisting any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
heavy cannonade. The <i>Independencia</i> was an
older type ironclad, of 2,000 tons, built in London
in 1865.</p>

<p>The <i>Esmeralda</i> was a wooden corvette, and the
<i>Covadonga</i> a wooden gunboat which had been
captured from the Spaniards in the expedition sent
by Spain against Chile and Peru in 1866. They
carried Armstrong and Nordenfelt guns. The
Chileans had some powerful ironclads, as we shall
see later, but they were investing Callao at the
moment.</p>

<p>Thus unequally armed, the contestants began the
engagement. The <i>Huascar</i> opened fire upon the
<i>Covadonga</i> and the <i>Independencia</i> strove to ram
her. The <i>Huascar</i> then turned her attention to
the <i>Esmeralda</i>, and so the battle proceeded for a
space. At length, the <i>Esmeralda</i>, feeling the inferiority
of her structure, adopted the ruse of
steaming into shoal water, hoping to draw her
antagonist of greater draught ashore. But ill-fortune
frustrated this attempt. There was a loud
explosion on board, and it was found that a boiler
had burst, crippling her. The <i>Huascar</i> rapidly
closed in to 1,000 yards, and at this range the
two vessels continued to bombard each other in
a struggle to the death, Chilean and Peruvian each
serving their guns with equal valour. The noise
of the cannonade resounded over the crisp waves
of the Pacific and rumbled far inland over the
desolate wastes of Tarapacá.</p>

<p>Fortune was against the Chilean. A shell struck
her, set her on fire, killing a number of her crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and practically putting her out of action. But the
gallant Pratt was not of the stuff that surrenders,
notwithstanding the condition of his ship&mdash;littered
with dead and wounded and in imminent danger
of sinking. He would not strike his flag, whilst
the Araucanian blood of his sailors, which never
gives way, would first go down to death, and the
vessel continued her now enfeebled fire.</p>

<p>The <i>Huascar</i>, protected by her armour, was little
injured, and Grau, to end the struggle, determined
to ram. The ironclad rushed in upon the wooden
hull of her victim, ramming her on the port side.
Seeing that all was lost and determined at least
to sell his life dearly, Captain Pratt leapt from
his own craft upon the Peruvian's deck. But a
single man had time to follow him before the
ships separated again, and "Surrender! surrender!"
the Peruvians shouted. For reply, Pratt
rushed along the deck, attacked all who opposed
him, and, engaging a Peruvian officer, slew him.
But so unequal a contest could not last, and,
pierced by a dozen bullets, the gallant Pratt fell
dead.</p>

<p>But the <i>Esmeralda</i> refused to strike her flag,
the standard of the single star, which still waved
proudly from her peak. Her second in command
swore he would follow the example of his chief,
and so it befel. The vessels closed again, the
beak of the Peruvian ramming the <i>Esmeralda</i> on
the starboard bow, opening a breach. The waters
rushed in, the furnace fires were extinguished, the
seamen were killed at their posts, but ere they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
separated, the commanding officer and a sailor
leaped upon the <i>Huascar's</i> deck and died fighting,
falling as Pratt had fallen. Again the <i>Huascar</i>
rammed, simultaneously discharging her guns into
the bowels of the doomed corvette. It was the
end; the <i>Esmeralda</i> went down, carrying with her
to a sailor's grave all but fifty of her crew of two
hundred souls. As for the <i>Covadonga</i>, she fled
into shoal water, and the <i>Independencia</i> following,
ran aground on the rocks, a total wreck, and the
<i>Covadonga</i> opened fire upon her.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this loss, Grau harassed the
enemy for months with his single ironclad, until
excitement in Chile caused the dispatch of the
Chilean fleet, which, having been overhauled, was
sent to hunt down this brave and persistent unit to
the death.</p>

<p>A misty morning off the coast of Tarapacá.
Two Peruvian war vessels, the <i>Huascar</i> and the
<i>Union</i>, are steaming quietly to the north. The mist
lifts, and to the east disclosed the sandy desert
shore and the far, faint, grey range of the Andes.
To the west, what? Three lines of smoke from
as many hostile funnels. The <i>Union</i> was an indefensible
vessel, and Grau signalled her to escape.
And now on the north-west three other ominous
trails of smoke appear&mdash;smoke from the Chilean
vessels&mdash;the <i>Almirante Cochrane</i>, so named after
Lord Cochrane, the Englishman famous in Chilean
history; the <i>O'Higgins</i>, named after the Irish
President of Chile; and the <i>Loa</i>.</p>

<p>Escape was impossible, unless it were by fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a way through the line, and, against these
odds, the brave Grau prepared his ship for action.
He opened fire, striking the <i>Cochrane</i>, whose
armour, however, was too strong to pierce, and,
at a thousand yards, the Chilean replied. His
shot struck the old hand-worked turret of the
<i>Huascar</i> so that it ceased to revolve. Grau closed
in and strove to ram, but the <i>Cochrane</i> was a
twin-screw steamer, and was manipulated well.
The <i>Cochrane's</i> armour was thick, her armament
heavy, her weight three times that of the old
<i>Huascar</i>. For two hours the unequal fight raged
on; shot and shell rained from both vessels, often
doing but little damage.</p>

<p>Grau was in the conning-tower when his end
came, directing the action of his ship, calm and
collected. Suddenly there was a crash, and when
the smoke cleared away it was seen that the
conning-tower had been struck by a shell. It
was blown to pieces, as were the brave Peruvian
admiral and his officer, nothing remaining of their
bodies but a few ghastly fragments.</p>

<p>And now the powerful <i>Blanco Encalada</i>, one
of the Chilean ironclads, closed in. A shell from
her guns at six hundred yards took off the head
of the <i>Huascar's</i> second in command and wounded
the third officer. Scarcely had the fourth had
time to take his place when he was injured by a
shell, and the junior lieutenant assumed command
of a ship littered with the dead and dying. Yet
though the guns in the tops were silent and those
below disabled, the turret injured, the deck strewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with mutilated bodies, the Peruvians kept up the
fight, the dying <i>Huascar</i> striving at least to ram
one of her enemies before she sank. But at length,
being utterly disabled, the vessel hauled down her
flag.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended this epic sea-fight, and with it went
the sea-power of Peru. Thus, moreover, was the
value of the ironclad demonstrated&mdash;the armoured
vessel, the forbear of the <i>Dreadnought</i>. The torpedo
was also used in this fight, one fired by the
<i>Huascar</i> turning back upon the vessel itself,
where it would have caused disaster earlier had
not a sailor jumped overboard and diverted its
course.</p>

<p>The attack on Lima by the Chileans and its
defence by the Peruvians, and other episodes of
the war following on the above events, make terrible
reading&mdash;a history of which, however, we cannot
here enter upon.</p>

<p>We continue to pass the coasts of the nitrate-bearing
lands, whose working and export yield the
Republic of Chile their greatest source of revenue.</p>

<p>It was off the Chilean coast, it will be recollected,
that another and more modern engagement
between vessels of war took place, when a
weaker British squadron was overpowered by the
German Pacific Fleet&mdash;a disaster amply wiped out
off the Falkland Isles, a little later on.</p>

<p>The railway that ascends from the port of
Antofagasta also enters upon the nitrate pampas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and there are copper-bearing districts tributary to
the line. At 10,000 feet elevation the River
Loa is crossed, and beyond we approach the ever-smoking,
snow-capped cone of San Pedro, one of
the Andean volcanoes here. Then the gleaming
surface of the borax "lake" of Cebollar, the
largest borax deposit on the face of the globe,
catches the eye. The great snow-clad Cordillera,
with the giant Ollague, 20,000 feet, on the border
of Chile and Bolivia, is passed, and the railway
reaches the Bolivian plateau, the southern portion
of the Titicaca basin, and passes the town of Unini,
with its rich silver mines, skirts Lake Poopo, and
reaches the town of Oruro, famous for its tin.</p>

<p>Beyond, this interesting line reaches La Paz,
the capital of Bolivia. The same place is now
served by the railway recently built from Arica,
and thus the interior of the mountainous Republic
of Bolivia is rendered more accessible. Recent
construction has effected a juncture with the railway
system of Argentina, thus affording a further
transcontinental route.</p>

<p>After the Tropic of Capricorn is passed, the
Andes approach nearer to the sea, revealing their
snowy crests from the steamer's deck, and from
Valparaiso the fruitful valleys of Chile unfold,
watered from the mountains&mdash;a more temperate
zone, where the flowers as of Europe may be seen
and the culture of the Chilean people is displayed.</p>

<p>Of his native land a Chilean poet sings that
its bulwarks are the mighty Cordillera, its frontiers
the sea&mdash;a romantically expressed conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the position of Chile which is geographically
correct.</p>

<p>A zone of territory three thousand miles in length
and nowhere broader than two hundred miles, and,
in general, only a hundred, confined between the
Andes and the Pacific Ocean, the Republic
has perhaps the most curious form of any
country in the world. Under his own flag the
Chilean may journey from the heat of the Tropics
to the cold of the Antarctic by taking steamer up
and down his coast or by a more or less arduous
land journey along the littoral. Such is the topography
of this interesting land&mdash;interspersed with
burning deserts, fruitful valleys and with glimpses
of delightful landscape, snowy mountains and
profound forests.</p>

<p>To have opened a sketch of Chile with a reference
to a poetical conception is not to argue that
the Chileans are a dreamy and over-poetical folk.
They are, on the contrary, practical, hardy, and
courageous&mdash;courage which, in their conflicts with
their neighbours in the past, and in their own internecine
strife and revolution, has at times given
way to cruelty and savagery&mdash;a condition, however,
not confined to these more southern inhabitants
of the South American Continent.</p>

<p>By reason of their more practical ideas and
enterprise in commercial matters, their ability&mdash;which
is largely absent from the Spanish American
people as a rule&mdash;of forming successful joint-stock
companies to exploit this or that field of industry
or finance, their superior navy and seamanship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and for diverse reasons, the Chileans have been
termed, or have liked to term themselves, the
"English of South America" a soubriquet varied
by the appellation of the "Americans or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Yanquis</i>
(Yankees) of South America." The Chilean Navy
was modelled after that of Britain; the army,
however, after the German style.</p>

<p>The early history of Chile, if less picturesque
than that of Peru, is full of incident&mdash;often dreadful&mdash;and
doughty deeds. Bluff old Almagro it
was who set his eyes upon Chile&mdash;Almagro, the
partner of Francisco Pizarro, partners whose
quarrels finally resulted in the death of both.</p>

<p>The Indians of Cuzco had told their conquerors
of a land that lay beyond the desert and the mountains
to the south, reaching no man knew whither;
a land not a great empire, but one of many tribes,
and so easily to be subdued, and, moreover, overflowing
with gold and silver. This land they called
Chile. Fiery spirits flocked to Almagro's standard
from Panama for another of those "dare-devil
heroic marches into the unknown world which
only greed and faith could inspire." Almagro's
band consisted of 600 white men and 15,000
Indians, and it left Cuzco in 1535.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To have descended to the coast and thence
march by the lowlands would have been the easiest
way, but it was the longer, and the adventurers
were as impatient to reach their goal as the Pizarros
were to see them gone: so Almagro marched
straight along the Inca road, past Lake Titicaca,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
across part of Bolivia and what is now Argentina,
and then over the Andes. Daring and difficult
as some of the Spanish marches had been, none
hitherto had had to encounter the hardships that
faced Almagro on his Andean progress. Cold,
famine, and toilsome ways killed his followers by
thousands, and to the frost and snow of the mountain
sides succeeded hundreds of miles of arid
deserts, where no living thing grew and no drop
of water fell.</p>

<p>"At length, with but a small remnant of his host,
Almagro found himself in a well-defined region,
consisting roughly of a vast valley running north
and south, the giant chain of the Andes enclosing
it on the east with foothills and spurs projecting
far into, and in some places almost intersecting,
the narrow plain, and a lower range of mountains
bordering it upon the west, and shutting it off
from the sea, except here and there, where a break
in the chain occurred. The valley was relatively
narrow, so narrow that in many places the hills
on either side were clearly visible, but the adventurers
as yet knew not that this curious strip of
broken plain between two mountain ranges extended
with its immense line of coast for well-nigh
2,000 miles, and was destined to become,
from its natural formation, the first maritime
nation of South America.</p>

<p>"Almagro found the sturdy, skin-clad tribesmen
of the mountain slopes and elevated plains far
different foemen from the soft, mild slaves of the
Incas in the tropical north. Their very name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Chile came from the word meaning cold; and
their temperate climate had hardened them and
made them robust. Gold and silver, it is true,
they had in plenty, and held them in no very high
esteem, but they fought with a fierceness of which
the Spaniards had had no experience in America
in defence of their liberty and right to live.
This, it was clear, was to be no easy conquest,
and Almagro, learning that the Peruvians of the
north had risen in a mass against the Spanish
oppression, abandoned Chile, and marched back
to Peru to fish in troubled waters, and in due time
to meet a felon's death at the hands of vengeful
Pizarro.</p>

<p>"But the tales of the rich and fertile land of the
south had whetted the greed of the victor, and
when old Almagro was finally disposed of, Pizarro
set about adding Chile to his own vast domain, held
for Charles the Emperor and King of Spain, with
the sanction of Holy Mother Church. The news
of Almagro's formal annexation of Chile to the
Spanish Crown, as usual in such cases, set the
hungry courtiers of Madrid clamouring for a share
of the spoil and glory, and an incompetent nonentity
called Pedro Sanchez de la Hoz was sent out
from Spain to complete the conquest of the new
domain in the name of the Emperor. Pizarro
knew well how to deal with such folk, and whilst
appearing to respect the imperial orders, really
stultified them. What he needed to do his work
were iron soldiers, dour Estremenians, like himself;
who knew neither ruth nor fear, and one he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
found after his own heart in Pedro de Valdivia,
who in the five years since he had joined the chief
in Peru, had proved that he possessed all the
qualities for repeating in Chile the success of
Pizarro in the empire of the Incas. Sanchez de la
Hoz, nominally the leader, promptly became the
cipher that nature had intended him to be, and
Valdivia took the lead.</p>

<p>"This time, in 1540, the safer way by the coast
desert was taken, and with a mere handful of
150 Spanish soldiers, but accompanied by a great
host of Indians, Valdivia marched through the interminable
valley, carrying with him rapine and
oppression for the gold he coveted. A great
pitched battle for a time, early in 1541, decided
the supremacy of the white men, and Valdivia,
with superhuman energy and cruelty unexampled,
set tens of thousands of Indians to work washing
auriferous sand, delving in mines, cutting roads
that still exist, and clearing the way for the advance
of the Spaniards southward. In a lovely, fertile,
elevated plain, with the eternal snow-capped Andes
looking down upon it, Valdivia founded the
capital of his new domain, the city of Santiago,
on the morrow of his victory in February 1541,
and from the height of St. Lucia above, upon the
spot where the conqueror overlooked the building
of his city, his gallant figure in bronze still
dominates the fair scene of his prowess.</p>

<p>"Fighting almost constantly for years, Valdivia,
with ever-growing forces, pushed farther south.
Valparaiso was founded in 1544 as the main seaport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for the capital, and two years afterwards the
conqueror crossed the Biobio River and entered
the fertile agricultural and pastoral country of
the Araucanians. Refined and cultivated as the
Incas of the north had been, these stalwart Indians
of the temperate south surpassed them in the
sterner virtues and in the arts of war. Tales of
their lofty stature and mighty strength grew with
the telling, and the Spaniards acknowledged that
at last they had met in America a people who
were more than their match. Concepcion, Talcahuano,
Imperial, Valdivia, one city after the other
rose in this land of forests and fighters, to be
destroyed again and again, only to be rebuilt.
Gold in abundance, surpassing the visions even
of the Spaniards, was to be had for the digging
or washing, but the Indians would only dig or
wash the metal whilst a white man with a
harquebus stood over them, and not always then.
Poison and treachery were common to both sides,
and cruelty surpassed itself. In one battle Valdivia
cut off the hands and noses of hundreds of
Indian prisoners and sent them back as an object
lesson, and the Araucanians, with devilish irony,
killed the Spaniards by pouring molten gold down
their throats.</p>

<p>"The lands through which the Spaniards passed
were teeming with fertility, and tilled like a garden,
and the sands of the frequent rivers abounded
in gold; but the people were hard to enslave,
and the leader that at last aroused them for a
final successful stand was Valdivia's own Araucanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
serf, Lautaro. The Christian chief fell into
an ambush led by him in 1553, and though
Valdivia begged and bribed hard for his life,
vengeance sated itself upon him. His heart was
cut out, and the Indian arrows soaked in his blood,
the heart itself, divided into morsels, being afterwards
eaten by the braves, whilst his bones were
turned into fifes to hearten the tribesmen to resist
the invaders.</p>

<p>"For well-nigh a hundred years the fight went
on in the country extending from the Biobio to
the archipelago of Chiloé, and it ended at last
in the formal recognition of the independence of
this splendid race, who had withstood in turn the
Inca and the white man. Even then the struggle
was not over, for the Spaniards could ill brook
the presence of an independent Indian people in
their midst as civilization and population grew in
South America. But what force and warfare could
never compass, time, intermarriage and culture
have gradually effected, and in our own times the
Araucanians have become Chilean citizens."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Chile threw off the yoke of Spain in 1810.
The yoke upon the Indies was really falling off
itself. Spain was too weak to coerce her colonies
much longer. But in 1814 Spain tried again.
A half-Irish Chilean patriot was the hero of this
struggle, a patriot who, his ammunition giving out,
charged his guns with coin in lieu of grapeshot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and cut his way to Santiago, and he on land and
the Englishman Cochrane on the sea caused Chile
to become one of the foremost factors in the final
liberation.</p>

<p>Many travellers have rendered homage to the
beauty of the Chilean landscape. "The appearance
of the Andes from the Central Valley is
always imposing, grandiose and magnificent. They
are unique: it is worth crossing half the world
to see them. The dry, stimulating air and the
beautiful cloudless sky in themselves provoke
enthusiasm."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere I have spoken of "the beautiful
Andes and the death-dealing Andes." Almagro's
terrible march across the Chilean Andes, as described
elsewhere, shows these characteristics of
the Cordillera vividly.</p>

<p>Much of the early history of Chile is made
up of the rebellion of the Indians; their attacks
upon the coastal towns, such as Concepcion and
Valdivia, which they sacked, massacring the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>The town of Concepcion, in 1751, suffered
something of the fate that overtook Lima and
Callao in the earthquake and tidal wave, and
Santiago, too, suffered greatly. With a crash the
tower of the cathedral fell, awakening the inhabitants
at midnight. There were horrible rumbling
noises&mdash;those curious subterranean earthquake
voices in the Andes. "There was scarcely time
to pray to God," say the chroniclers. Every single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
church and house was thrown down, and nobody
could even stand upright. Those who could, flew:
they fled to the hills for refuge&mdash;refuge from the
sea, the dreadful tidal wave. For the ocean retreated,
as if mustering force for the deluge. Then
it returned, not once, but thrice, washing over Concepcion
as if the day of doom indeed had come.</p>

<p>The destruction of Valparaiso in August 1906
was the last terrible disaster of this nature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The day had been unusually calm and pleasant.
At about 8 p.m. there was a sudden, unexpected
shock, immediately followed by another; the whole
city seemed to swing backwards and forwards:
then there was a horrible jolt, and whole rows of
buildings (about thirty blocks of houses, three to
five stories high, in the Avenida Brasil alone) fell
with a terrific crash. The gas, electric-light and
water mains were at once snapped, and the whole
city was plunged in darkness. This, however,
did not last long, for, five minutes after
the shock, great fires started in the ruined buildings
about the Plaza del Orden, and, aided by a
violent storm wind, which began about the same
time, spread northwards over the city. Between
the earthquake and the subsequent fire ninety
per cent. of the houses are said to have been destroyed.
The Arsenal, station, custom-house, hospitals,
convents, banks, club-houses and Grand
Hotel were for the most part ruined, for without
water, and in the horrible confusion that at first
prevailed, it was almost impossible to check the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fires.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But the authorities showed no lack of
energy and presence of mind. Patrols of troops
and armed citizens kept watch; thieves and
marauders attempting to loot were shot. The fire
was, where possible, checked by dynamite. Messengers
on horseback were sent to Santiago and
other places, appealing for help, and especially
for provisions. The telegraph lines were destroyed;
the railways were wrecked for miles&mdash;bridges
had twisted and tunnels had caved in&mdash;but
communication with Santiago seems to have
been re-established within a wonderfully short
time. This was all the more creditable, for the
shocks continued on Friday and Saturday, and
apparently did not cease until about 6 a.m. on
Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"The condition of the wretched inhabitants was
most pitiable. Some 60,000 were encamped on
the barren hills above the town without food or
clothing; others took refuge on boats or steamers
in the bay, for mercifully there was no tidal wave
such as commonly accompanies great earth tremors
on that coast, and no damage was done to the
shipping in harbour.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The number of people
killed has been variously estimated at from 300
to 10,000 persons; it is probable that from 500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to 1,000 were killed and another 1,000 wounded.
The damage done was at least £20,000,000."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From earliest times the history of Chile upon
this coast has been a tortured one&mdash;the barbarities
and the sufferings both of the early Spanish conquerors,
the reprisals of the Indians, the bloodthirsty
and unsubduable Araucanians, the feuds
between the Spaniards themselves, the toll of
earthquakes and tidal waves, the battles between
Spaniard and colonist and between Chilean and
Peruvian and Bolivian, the dreadful pages of revolutionary
and civil strife. It is veritably a blood-stained
coast, and both man and nature might
well cry to Heaven for surcease. Yet to-day there
hangs a menace over it&mdash;the feud with Peru over
Tacna and Arica: and for the future the savage
strikes of the workers against the oligarchies of
industry.</p>

<p>But we need not dwell too much on this
aspect. There are many beautiful and peaceful
attributes about the land, much to admire in its
people. It has been said that Chile seems to rise
more vigorous and more enterprising after every
disaster.</p>

<p>Let us turn for a space to view somewhat more
in detail the Chilean capital, as described by a
recent writer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Santiago, 'most noble and most loyal,' is a
mixture of Paris, Madrid and Seville. It is far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
ahead of Spanish towns in its electric tramways,
broad avenues and brisk movement. But the
larger houses are all characteristically Spanish.
They are built round a central court or patio,
which is usually open to the sky above and full
of flowers and graceful shrubs. Very often there
are sparkling fountains and statuary also. In fact,
through the great gateway of a large Santiago
house the most delicious little views of water,
flowers and greenery can be gathered in passing.
This gateway has heavy wooden doors, carefully
locked at night; the windows opening on the
street are usually heavily barred, which is by no
means a useless precaution.</p>

<p>"The design of these houses is a very ancient
one. Four stone huts, placed so as to enclose a
square, and with but one opening to the outside,
form a miniature fort; even the mansions of the
great Santiago families, with four or more stories,
and with the street front elaborately decorated,
are but a development of this very simple
arrangement.</p>

<p>"It is in Santiago that one discovers what marvellous
and gorgeous results can be obtained by
the use of stucco. Very often it is tinted by rose-pink
or terracotta, and it is simple and easy to
make Corinthian, Doric or Ionic columns, to
model flowers, wreaths, vases, and Cupids, and
other classical figures by means of this plastic
material.</p>

<p>"The streets run, as is almost invariably the
case in South America, at right angles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Alameda is a delicious avenue planted with trees,
and traversed by little streams of running water
which give a pleasant, murmuring sound and cool
the hot air of midday. Amongst the trees are
statues such as those of Bernardo O'Higgins, San
Martin and many others.</p>

<p>"The Plaza da Armas has colonnades along the
sides which are famous in Chilean history, but is
possibly a little disappointing. Most of the other
public buildings, though fine and magnificent, do
not show any very special distinctive character.
It is the enormous size, business-like character
and thoroughly business-like tone that distinguish
Santiago. It is quite obviously a metropolis, and
indeed, to the upper classes in Chile, it is what
Paris is to every Frenchman.</p>

<p>"The Quinta Normal, with its library,
Herbarium and Zoological Gardens, where the
Niata cattle mentioned by Darwin are still maintained,
is a sort of Jardin d'Acclimatation and
Jardin des Plantes in one.</p>

<p>"In fact, the French, or rather Parisian, instincts
of the upper classes in Santiago can be noticed
at every turn.</p>

<p>"It is the fashion of books on Chile for the
author to wax eloquent on the Cerro de Santa
Lucia. This rugged, projecting rock overlooking
Santiago should remind one vividly of Pedro de
Valdivia, of Señora Suarez, and of the heroical
little band that starved out there the first two
momentous years of Chilean history.</p>

<p>"'In this valley, two leagues from the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Cordillera, by the side of the River Mapocho, God
has planted a mountain of a beautiful aspect and
proportion which is like a watch-tower from which
the whole plain is discovered with the variety of
its culture in arable and meadow.'</p>

<p>"That is how Ovalle describes the hill of Santa
Lucia in his time.</p>

<p>"But what has been done with it? Stucco
vases, balconies, balustrades, gardens, restaurants,
and even a theatre, make it impossible, even for
a moment, to remember the Conquistadores. The
view is, however, still magnificent, and it is from
the Santa Lucia that one can obtain the best
possible idea of Santiago itself.</p>

<p>"In the mornings, one may see the Santiago
ladies hurrying to the churches. The power of
the clergy is perhaps most easily realized from
the fact that no woman dares to enter the church
in a hat or bonnet. Every one, rich or poor, noble
or lowly, wears the inevitable Manto. This is a
sort of black shawl; it is sometimes of very rich
and beautiful material, and it is always folded
in such a manner that it is as becoming as possible.</p>

<p>"In the afternoons there are fine horses and
carriages to be seen, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i> may
be observed sauntering through the streets and
staring in an open and unabashed manner at every
lady that passes. It is not considered bad form;
indeed, it is supposed to be the correct thing to
make audible remarks on a lady's personal appearance.
'How beautiful is the little one! What
sympathetic eyes has the elder lady!' and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"The physical appearance of some of these
young aristocrats (if they really belong to the
highest social circles) is not impressive. One
notices everywhere the narrow chest, sloping
shoulders and effeminate appearance of the typical
Parisian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roué</i>. The corner-boys, even, resemble
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">apache</i> of the boulevards, and are as dangerous
and cowardly as these degenerate types of city
life.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the most characteristic custom of
Santiago and of all Chilean cities is the evening
'Paseo,' or promenade. After dinner, in the cool
of the evening, people saunter under the trees,
very often in some public garden where a good
band is playing, and gossip over the events of
the day.</p>

<p>"There does not seem to be much jealousy or
ill-feeling between the upper and lower classes
in Chile, for the masses keep to a different part
of the Plaza, and do not intrude upon the pacing-ground
of the richer or better-dressed people.</p>

<p>"This evening promenade is attended by quite
small boys and girls. They do not mix, but keep
quite separate paths. Yet even the little girls of
seven or eight years old are finished coquettes.
Their eyes languishingly observe every man and
boy in the Plaza, and they take care that each
shall receive a due share of their smiles!</p>

<p>"The governing classes of Chile are, for the most
part, descendants of the Spanish Conquistadores.
They preserve in their own hands not merely all important
government posts (civil, military and naval),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but also they own most of the large landed estates.
A few of them, which is very unusual in Spanish
American countries, not only own but take some
part in the management of nitrate oficinas, banks,
mines and other industries. Almost all the
lawyers and doctors are of Chilean birth. There
are two Universities, which supply, in a very ample
and generous manner, advocates, solicitors and
medical men.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, mercantile business of all
kinds, both on the large and on the small scale,
is carried on almost invariably by foreigners. The
old Spanish prejudice against traders is by no
means dead. Even the small shopkeepers seem
to be usually Spanish Basques and Italians.</p>

<p>"In the south there are many small farms owned
by Germans, French, Swiss, British, and some
Danes, Swedes and Norwegians; even Indians
own much of the land in the south. But the
working-class throughout Chile, in the mines, in
towns, on the farms, and, indeed, everywhere, are
Chilenos. Chile is not the place for a British
or Continental workman.</p>

<p>"There is a very well-marked difference between
the Chileno inquilino or peon and the better classes,
whether Chilean or foreign. But amongst the
Chilean or Santiago aristocracy one finds such
names as Edwards, Simpson, Walker, Rogers and
Porter. These, of course, are of British or Irish
descent. Towards the end of the eighteenth century,
many exceptionally gifted foreigners drifted
to Chile. They were educated, business-like and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
capable people. If one remembers that the first
line of steamers to Europe only began to run
some fifty years ago, it is obvious that such men
should have been able to acquire wealth. They
were respected, even liked and appreciated, by the
Chilians of those days. Many distinguished themselves
in the Army and Navy. But their descendants
are pure Chilenos now, and very likely
quite unable to read or speak any tongue save
Spanish. This is not surprising, for one can see
the process of assimilation going on even at the
present day.</p>

<p>"Any young foreigner who has business instincts
and ordinary common sense will, of course, learn to
speak Spanish. Should he possess the necessary
industry and talent, he may find himself early in
life in a position of some importance, which involves
dealing with the better-class Chilenos. He
will in all probability marry a Chilean señorita.
The truth is that it is not very easy to resist
a Chilean girl when she is inclined to be
gracious.</p>

<p>"She is not at all an advanced woman; she
is not inclined to tyrannize over her husband, but
is quite content to leave him to manage his affairs
and his house as he pleases. She never dreams
of contesting his marital authority. It is true
that she is not very energetic, but then, is not
that an agreeable change?</p>

<p>"Our young Scotchman's or Englishman's
children will be entirely Chilean in ideals, in aspiration
and in training. They may be sent home for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
education, but a few months after their return to
Chile no one could distinguish them from the
Chilean <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pur sang</i>. The father will, no doubt, retain
a sentimental regard for the old country, but in
Chile it is exceedingly unlikely that he would ever
desire to return permanently to the rain, snow, slush
and fogs of Britain, where he will be, not a leading
aristocrat, but merely a business man of sorts.</p>

<p>"But though the somewhat Frenchified Chilean
aristocracy and cosmopolitan foreigners are of interest,
the really important person is the Chileno
peon, inquilino or huaso of the working class.</p>

<p>"There is no country in the world which has so
valuable a working class (with the possible exception
of Japan and China). They are descended
from the Araucanian Indian and the Spanish Andalusian
or the Basque. They are hardy, vigorous
and excellent workmen, and their endurance and
patience are almost Indian. Of their bravery and
determination it is unnecessary to speak, for these
qualities appear on every page of the stormy history
of Chile. Generally, they are short, dark-eyed
and black-haired people. They are intelligent, and
quick to learn anything requiring handiness and
craftsmanship. They have, of course, many faults:
at intervals they drink to excess when they can,
and they are hot-blooded and quarrelsome; knives
will be drawn and a fight started on very small
provocation. As regards honesty, they are certainly
no worse than others of their kind, and in
the country districts they are better than most.
Perhaps, economically speaking, the fact that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
live and work contentedly on exceedingly low wages
(chiefly on beans) is one of their most important
characteristics."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of the vineyards and pastures, the many industries,
the famous wines of the country, the cattle,
the industrious folk, the forests and the fishing,
the great mining enterprises, copper and all ore, the
rivers and the railways, the German colony of
Valdivia and the pleasing towns of the coast we
cannot here speak in detail.</p>

<p>Chile is fortunate, industrially, in her great
coalfields at Lota and elsewhere in the south, which
form the basis of considerable industry. The
seams in some cases dip beneath the Pacific.</p>

<p>Chile is a land that offers much by reason of
its temperate climate, and these more southern
regions may be expected to attain to greater importance
in the future.</p>

<p>For a thousand miles, perhaps, the littoral still
unfolds to the south, with great fiords and forests,
terminating in a maze of channels which line the
coast of Patagonia to Magellan Strait and Cape
Horn. There is a race of hardy Indian boatmen
here, a tribe which, it is said, "throw their women
overboard in a storm to lighten the canoe." It is
a land cold and stormy, with a little-known interior,
which the early explorers described as being
inhabited by giants or people with big feet&mdash;hence
the name of Patagonia. For hundreds of miles the
Pacific slope is a thick, continuous forest. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in the Strait of Magellan lies a prosperous
Chilean colony, where vast flocks of sheep thrive&mdash;the
colony of Punta Arenas, the world's southernmost
seaport.</p>

<p>Magellan, the intrepid Portuguese navigator of
early times, whose name the Strait bears, bore
bravely out into the great south sea which he
named the Pacific. His crew were weak with
cold and hunger. But he would push on, "even
if they had to eat the leather of the rigging."
Ox-hides, rats and sawdust, indeed, they did eat.
On to the west the vessels sailed, across the unknown
sea&mdash;"almost beyond the grasp of man
for vastness"&mdash;to circumnavigate the globe for
home.</p>

<p>Magellan himself did not finish the voyage,
although he crossed the Pacific, for his earthly
race was run; he left his bones in the Philippines.
But the ship and his pilot, Sebastian del Cano,
a Spaniard, reached home, and Cano was given
the arms of nobility, with the device of a ship
and globe and the inscription <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu Solus circumdedesti
me</i>.</p>

<p>From the Pacific coast we shall now ascend

<h3>THE CORDILLERA OF THE ANDES</h3>

<h4>IN ECUADOR, PERU AND BOLIVIA</h4>


<p>Siste, viator; draw rein: your mule will stop
willingly; he is stricken with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">soroche</i> perhaps,
the malady of the mountain, which you yourself
may suffer if at this elevation, where but half an
atmosphere presses upon us and oxygen is scant,
you attempt to run or climb. Draw rein upon
this summit and look beyond. There is a
panorama it were worth a journey over a hemisphere
to see. Range and peak are clothed with
perpetual snow, which gleams like porcelain in
the sun.</p>

<p>Heavenward thrown, crumpled, folded, ridged
and fractured, with gnomon-fashioned uplifts pointing
to the sky, shattered strata and sheer crevasse,
natural terrace and grim escarpment, hung over
with filmy mist-veils and robed with the white
clothing of its snowfields, and, when the windows
of heaven are open, drenched with the deluges
intercepted from the boundless plains and forests
far beyond; the father of the rivers whose floods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
are borne a thousand leagues away the Cordillera
crouches, rears and groans upon the western seaboard
of the continent. The beautiful Andes, the
terrible Andes, the life-giving Andes, the death-dealing
Andes&mdash;so we might apostrophize them&mdash;for
the Cordillera is of many moods, and whatever
change of adjectives the traveller may
ring, he will fail of truly describing this mighty
chain.</p>

<p>When the delicate tints of early morning shine
on the crested snow in rarest beauty, and the light
and tonic air invigorates both man and horse, the
leagues pass swiftly by. Night falls, or the snow-cloud
gathers, or the pelting rain descends; then
does the weight of weariness and melancholy
descend upon us<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;so have I felt it.</p>

<p>The name of the Andes, to the traveller who
has crossed the giddy passes and scaled the high
peaks of this stupendous mountain chain, brings
back sensations which are a blend of the pleasurable
and the painful. In his retrospect the Cordillera&mdash;for
such is its familiar name to the inhabitants
of the land it traverses&mdash;bulks as a thing of varied
and almost indescribable moods. It possesses that
individuality&mdash;menacing, beautiful by turns&mdash;which
no doubt is an attribute of all mountains, in the
recollection of those who best know them.</p>

<p>The Andes are no playground, such as some of
the mountains of Europe have become, nor are
they the object or scene of climbing enterprise
and exploration such as bring the Himalayas so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
frequently before the geographically interested
public. Comparatively simple in their structure,
it is their enormous length&mdash;a wall unbroken,
extending for four thousand miles from north to
south along the western littoral of their continent&mdash;their
treeless aridity, their illimitable, dreary,
inclement uplands, and, these passed, their chaste
snowy peaks, tinged by the rising or the setting
sun, that most impress the traveller in those lands
they traverse.</p>

<p>Here in the higher elevations of these remote
fastnesses there are no material comforts for man
or beast. Humanity, as far as it has the hardihood
to dwell here, is confined to the Indian or
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizo</i>, who has paid nature the homage of
being born here, and so can dwell and work in
what is his native environment. In the more
sheltered valleys it is true that large centres of
population flourish; important towns which from
their elevation above sea-level&mdash;ten thousand or
twelve thousand feet&mdash;might look down as it were
from a dizzy height upon the highest inhabited
centres of Europe; whilst, did we establish industrious
mining communities on the peak of the
Matterhorn or Mont Blanc, we should still be far
below some of those places of the Peruvian and
Bolivian Andes where minerals are won for the
marts of Europe.</p>

<p>The Andes consist physiographically of two
great parallel chains, forming into three, with
lesser parallel undulations, in certain parts of its
course; the ranges being joined by <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">nudos</i> or knots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
as the transversal ridges are termed; a very well
marked structure. In places vast tablelands lie
between the high <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paramos</i> of Colombia, the
altiplanicies of Peru, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">punas</i> of Bolivia, often
studded with lakes, including the enormous Lake
Titicaca. In some cases these high uplands
between the enclosing Cordilleras are indeed dreary
and inclement, sparsely inhabited, and the dweller
of the lowlands loves not to sojourn there longer
than may be necessary for his purpose. Conversely,
the highlander fears the enervating climate
of the lowlands.</p>

<p>Between the more easterly paralleling ranges
great rivers run, having their birth in the snow-cap
and incessant rains, both of which are the
result of the deposition from the moisture-laden
trade winds which, sweeping across the Atlantic
and Brazil for thousands of miles, are intercepted
by the crest of the Cordillera, impinging thereon
and depositing their moisture. Running down the
easterly slope, in a thousand rills, the waters
gather in the giant channels, all flowing northwards,
in the troughs between the ranges, to where,
with curious regularity, they break through these
ranges in deep cuttings or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pongos</i>, as they are
there termed, like gargantuan mill-races, turning
thus east and pouring forth their floods upon the
Amazon plain, where, after vast courses amid the
forests, they reach the main stream of the Amazon,
and finally empty themselves on the coast of Brazil
into the Atlantic, whence they originally came upon
the wings of the wind&mdash;a mighty natural hydraulic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
engine, unceasing in its operations, stupendous in
its work. Yes; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Siste, viator</i>, draw rein&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hast thou entered the treasures of the snow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath cleft a channel for the water-flood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The imprint of the Andes perhaps never fades
from the mind of the traveller. When you have
braved the tempest and the steep, when your slow
and panting beast overcomes the last few rising
yards upon the maritime range that shuts off from
view the White Cordillera, then, as the dark horizon
of the foreground rocks gives place, your astonished
gaze rests upon that range of white-clothed
sentinels beyond, upraised some time since the
Jurassic or Silurian Ages. There they mark the
eras: there they stand, performing their silent and
allotted work; and there, when evening falls, it
tints their brows with orange and with carmine,
and wraps their bases with the purple pall of
finished day.</p>

<p>Borne upward three to five miles above the level
of the ocean arose these mighty guardians of the
western shore, carrying some ocean bed from where
it lay, where strange creatures of the deep reposed
within the ooze&mdash;huge ammonites and cephalopods,
whose fossil scrolls and circles, now petrified in
rigid schools upon the stiffened summits, catch the
traveller's eye as his weary mule stumbles over
the limestone ridges: and, blurred by the pelting
rain of the Andine winter and loosened from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
stony grasp by frost and sun and earthquake, they,
together with the rocky walls that hold them, are
again dissolving into particles; a phase within the
endless sequence of Nature's work; an accident
of her ceaseless and inexplicable operations.</p>

<p>Has this great Cordillera produced a high type
of humanity? Has the clear atmosphere, the
nearer approach to the clouds, the purity and
example of the heights made man here pure and
noble? We shall judge later, after viewing the
palimpsest of history here, following on the
palimpsest of Nature, for the Cordillera is a
scroll of time, erased, rewritten in the physical
and in the human world. The Andes have been
blood-stained along all their four-thousand-mile
course, that we know, ever since the white man
trod them. We also know that before his time
the Cordillera did produce a high human culture,
that of the mysterious "Andine people," with their
successors, the Incas. Pagan, perhaps, but who,
in the long ages, had evolved some comprehension
of the "Unknown God," and whose social code was
more in tune with a true economic philosophy of
life than that of their successors.</p>

<p>Descending now from the clouds, metaphorically
and actually, we must glance more particularly
at the life of those modern countries which have
in part their home in the Cordillera, to whom the
Cordillera is a very real and palpable thing.</p>

<p>From north to south, Colombia, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile occupy this
extensive zone: countries whose general conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
as regards the littoral we have seen in our journey
along the Pacific coast. Excepting Bolivia, all
these lands have the advantages accruing from the
condition that they stretch from the coast across
the Andes, extending to the Amazon plains
beyond; thus enjoying zones respectively of coast,
mountain and forest, with all their diversity of
environment, climate and resource.</p>

<p>As we shall see in the chapter devoted to the
Amazon Valley, many navigable streams traverse
this forested region, giving access by launch or
canoe through thousands of miles of otherwise
inaccessible territory, for roads are often impossible
and of railways there are none.</p>

<p>Colombia we shall visit in another chapter.
Both Colombia and Venezuela lie in part upon
the Andes and face upon the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>Ecuador is but a small country in comparison
with the vaster areas of its neighbours, but Nature
has rendered it extremely diverse, and has dowered
it&mdash;it is a terrible gift, however&mdash;with some of
the most remarkable mountain forms on the face
of the globe. Nothing can exceed the stupendous
grandeur of the great "avenue" of snow-clad
volcanoes which arises before us around Quito and
terminates on the Equator.</p>

<p>In Ecuador Nature might seem to have thought
to display her powers after the manner of a model,
with every grade of climate, topographical form
and species of plant and animal life; to have
set up, within a measurable compass, an example
of her powers in the tropical world. The hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
lowlands of the coast, covered in part with the
densest and rankest vegetation, intersected by the
most fertile of valleys, where ripen the most
delicious and valuable fruits, with rivers wherein
the curious life of the Tropics has its home, from
gorgeous insect or bird down to the tortoise and
the loathly alligator, slope upwards to the bleakest
tablelands, the icy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paramos</i>, which themselves are
crowned with the snow-capped volcanoes, at times
belching forth fire and ash, carrying destruction
to fruitful field and populous town. Beyond lies
some of the most broken region on the earth's
surface, descending to the forests inhabited by
the half-naked and savage Indian, still outside the
pale of civilization or the influence of Christianity,
who may receive the incautious traveller with
deadly weapons of blow-pipe and poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>The uplands of Ecuador embody a high tableland,
cut up into three <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hoyas</i> or basins, known as
those of Quito, Ambato and Cuenca respectively.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Rising from both the eastern and western rims
of this elevated plateau are the higher Cordilleras,
their main summits culminating far above the perpetual
snowline, which in Ecuador lies at about
15,750 feet above sea-level. As before remarked,
due to their peculiarly symmetrical arrangement
and spectacular appearance, such an assemblage
of snow-clad peaks is not found in any other part
of the world. Not only for their height are the
Ecuadorian peaks noteworthy, but for their peculiar
occurrence in parallel lines, sometimes in pairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
facing each other across the 'cyclopean passage'
or avenue formed by the long plateau. There
are twenty-two of these great peaks, several of
which are actual volcanoes, grouped along the
central plains almost within sight of each other.
Built up by subterranean fires, the great mountain
edifices of Ecuador are sculptured by glacier
streams and perpetual snows. The volcanoes of
Ecuador have rendered the country famous among
geologists and travellers of all nationalities. They
were the terror of the primitive Indian, and objects
of awe and worship by the semi-civilized peoples
of the land, and have been at various periods
terrible scourges and engines of destruction.</p>

<p>"The largest number of high peaks and the
greatest average elevations occur upon the eastern
Andes, or Cordillera Oriental, whilst the western
or Occidental is distinguished by having the
highest individual elevations. The altitudes given
by various authorities of these peaks differ somewhat,
and the measurements of later investigators
vary considerably from those of Humboldt in
some cases. Humboldt was the first to study and
measure the Ecuadorian volcanoes, and La Condamine
measured them in 1742. The more
modern investigators were Drs. Reiss and Stübel,
who spent four years, from 1870 to 1874, in the
study, and in 1880 they were the subject of
Edward Whymper's famous travels. The alleged
remarkable condition of the sinking or rising of
various of these summits and localities may
account, it has been stated, for the variation found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
in measurements made at different times. It has
been estimated that a considerable decrease in the
elevation of the Ecuadorian Andes in the region
took place during last century. Quito has sunk,
it is stated, 26 feet in 122 years, and Pichincha
218 feet in the same period. The farm at
Antisana, where Humboldt lived for some time,
has sunk 165 feet in sixty-four years. On the
other hand, two of the active volcanoes, those of
Cotopaxi and Sangay, have increased in altitude
since they were measured by La Condamine, it
is asserted. Underlying seismic disturbances have
doubtless been the cause of these movements."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The highest of these peaks is Chimborazo,
20,498 feet, followed by Cotopaxi, 19,613 feet,
Antisana and Cayambe, both over 19,000 feet,
with others ranging downwards to about 14,000
feet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The great Cotopaxi, with its unrivalled cone,
is the most terrible and dangerous in Ecuador,
and the highest active volcano in the world.
From its summit smoke curls upwards unceasingly,
and knowledge of its activities begins with South
American history after the Conquest. The first
eruption experienced by the Spaniards was in
1534, during the attempted conquest of the
ancient native kingdom of Quito by Alvarado.
The Indians regarded the terrible outpourings of
the volcano, which coincided with this foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
advent, as a manifestation of Nature in aid of
the invaders and against themselves, and this was
a factor in breaking down their opposition. But
the rain of ashes from the burning mountain
greatly troubled the small army of Alvarado for
several days, as before described. After this out-burst
Cotopaxi remained quiescent for more than
two hundred years, until 1741, when it broke out
with extraordinary force, and became for twenty-six
years the scourge of the districts of Quito and
Latacunga. The province of Leon and Latacunga,
which formerly had been among the most beautiful
and fertile, became poverty-stricken by reason of
the eruptions. These outbreaks generally consisted
in a great rain of sand and ash, followed by vast
quantities of mud and water, which were thrown
over the valleys and plains, destroying whatever
lay in the way. Between 1742 and 1768 there
were seven great eruptions of this character, and
it is noteworthy that none of these were accompanied
by earthquakes. The thunderings were
heard at Honda, in Colombia, 500 miles away,
it is recorded. Cotopaxi then remained quiescent
for thirty-five years, until 1803, when Humboldt
heard the detonations of a new outbreak, like
discharges of a battery, from the Gulf of Guayaquil,
where he was on board a vessel for Lima.
A number of lesser outbreaks occurred during the
nineteenth century, but comparatively little record
has been kept of them. There were streams of
fresh lava, columns of black smoke, and showers
of sand sent forth at various periods, and in 1877<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a further memorable eruption took place, followed
by others up to 1880. It would appear that since
the volcano of Tunguragua entered again into
action Cotopaxi has been less vigorous. Cotopaxi
is regarded by various travellers as one of the
most beautiful mountain peaks in the world, its
symmetry of outline rivalling the famous Fuji-yama
of Japan, which it overtops by more than 7,000
feet. This Ecuadorian volcano is 2,000 feet
higher than Popocateptl, the "smoking mountain"
of Mexico, and more than 15,000 feet higher than
Vesuvius, and 7,000 higher than Teneriffe. It
rises in a symmetrical cone, with a slope of 29°
or 30°. Its height, as before given, is 19,613,
according to Whymper, and the crater varies from
2,300 feet to 1,650 feet in diameter, and is 1,200
feet deep approximately, bordered by a rim of
trachytic rock. The summit of Cotopaxi is
generally shrouded in cloud masses, and only
visible for a few days even in the clearest season
of the year."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This high region of Ecuador is gained by the
railway from Guayaquil to Quito, which ascends
amid some remarkable scenery over a difficult
route, traversing deep ravines and fertile districts.
Some of the passages are terrific in character.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Riobamba is reached at 9,020 feet. The town
is lighted from a hydro-electric station in the
mountain stream. Beyond this point Chimborazo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
bursts upon the view. The great mountain displays
a double peak, the snow-clad crests of which are
outlined against the upland sky, at those times
when the firmament is free from clouds. The
plateau of Riobamba has a healthy climate, described,
on the authority of Humboldt, as one of
the best in the world. In this region a considerable
increase in the production of wheat has followed
upon the building of the railway.</p>

<p>"Between Riobamba and Ambato the Chimborazo
pass is crossed, at Urbina, the highest point
reached, and thence a rapid descent is made to
Ambato, 8,435 feet in the midst of a district
producing fruits and foodstuffs abundantly. Along
the Latacunga Valley, comparatively flat and some
ten miles wide, rich pastures, intersected by irrigation
ditches, abound, with numerous bands of
cattle and horses. Grain, corn, potatoes, alfalfa,
apples, peaches, strawberries, etc., are products of
this high fertile district, and good cheese and
butter are made. Beyond the town of Latacunga,
9,055 feet elevation, the line crosses the base of
Cotopaxi, whose snowy cone is surmounted by the
thin, unceasing smokewreath from its crater, the
cloud hanging in the atmosphere. This point of
the line is 11,653 feet above sea-level, only
slightly less than that of the Chimborazo pass.
Beyond Cotopaxi lies the fertile valley of Machachi,
one of the most pleasing districts in Ecuador. On
either hand is the row of famous volcanoes, a
mighty avenue of great peaks, often clothed in
green up to the line of perpetual snow. A view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
is obtained from the railway of the Chillo Valley,
with various cotton and woollen mills, actuated by
water power. In these establishments, hydraulically
worked from the river, cloths of cheap
character for native clothing are made. Still
descending, the railway approaches and enters the
city of Quito at 9,375 feet elevation.</p>

<p>"The construction of this remarkable railway
from Guayaquil to Quito was mainly due to the activity
and enterprise of an American financier and
railway builder, Mr. Archer Harman, whose work
in connection with which began in 1897. The
line remains as a worthy monument to this man,
whose grave lies at the pretty town of Huigra.
A strong impulse was given to the progress of
Ecuador by the building of this railway and by
the influence of its builder, and the Republic has
cause to remember his name with gratitude, as
indeed has the traveller.</p>

<p>"Quito, the capital of Ecuador, is not without
an atmosphere of interest and even romance.
Remote and inaccessible as it has been until, in
the last few decades, the railway united it with
the outer world, Quito still conserves its character
of a mountain capital, surrounded by lofty snow-clad
volcanoes, whose names are bywords in
geography. There are many large towns in the
Andes, throughout Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and
Venezuela, but both by reason of its history and
its topography the capital of Ecuador is among
the most interesting. The Quito Valley lies at an
elevation of 9,500 feet above sea-level. Around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the upland valley are twenty noble volcanic
summits, whose variety of form is remarkable,
from the truncated to the perfect cone, from jagged
and sunken crests to smooth, snow-covered, gleaming
domes, among them the beautiful, if dreaded,
Cotopaxi. These mountains are fully described
in dealing with the peaks and volcanoes.</p>

<p>"The historical interest of Quito lies in the fact
that it was the ancient centre of the Shiri Empire,
formed by the mysterious Caras and the Quitus,
as described in the historical section of this work,
whose dynasty fell before the Incas under Huayna
Capac, who in their turn gave way to the Spaniards.
The famous Inca road, traversing the Cordilleras
and tablelands, joined Quito with Cuzco, passing
through the various centres of Inca civilization,
with their stone-built temples and palaces, flanked
by hill fortresses which guarded the heads of the
valleys to the east or the west against the attacks
of savage tribes. The remains of this road still
exist.</p>

<p>"As regards the character of the climate and
surroundings of Quito, opinions differ considerably.
It is difficult to comprehend why the Shiris and
the Incas should have built or maintained their
capital city upon such a spot, a small, broken
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">meseta</i>, or plain, as is that of Quito, or why the
Spaniards perpetuated it upon a site of so little
advantage and utility, when near at hand are the
flat lands of Turubamba and Añaquito, and not
very far off the spacious and delightful valleys
of Chillo and Tumbaco. Of all the towns on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
inter-Andine <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hoyas</i> Quito is the highest and coldest.
The surrounding vegetation is poor and of melancholy
aspect, and corresponds with the inclement
situation. The position is healthy and even agreeable
for those who are acclimatized thereto, but
the descriptions lavished by some writers thereon
of 'delicious' and of 'eternal spring' are exaggerations,
says one observer.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Another authority
says that 'the traveller is charmed in looking at
the carpet of perpetual verdancy on which Quito
stands. The climate is delightful. It is neither
summer nor spring nor winter, but each day of
the year offers a singular combination of the three
seasons. Neither cholera nor yellow fever nor
consumption is known there. The mild and healthy
temperature which prevails is something admirable.
In short, it may be said that the great plateau of
Quito is a kind of paradise.'<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Thus extremes
of opinion are seen to exist.</p>

<p>"The annual death-rate of Quito is given as
about 36 per 1,000,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but this might undoubtedly
be reduced under better sanitary measures. It is a
well-known circumstance that the high upland
regions and towns of the Andes are generally free
from pulmonary consumption, and tubercular
disease of the lungs, which on the coastal lowlands
of tropical America is very frequent, is
unknown above 8,000 feet.</p>

<p>"The aspect of Quito, is picturesque. The first
impression is that of a white city, relieved by roofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of red tiles, the streets thronged with interesting
people. As seen from the slopes of Pichincha,
which descend to the city on its western side, or
from the summit of the Panecillo, a small hill
standing within the borders of the city, or from
other high points near at hand, the city unfolds
pleasingly to the view. It may be likened to a
city of the third order in Europe. In spite of
the broken character of the land upon which it
is built, the streets are nearly all straight, the
principal thoroughfares being wide and paved. It
is traversed from west to east by two deep <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quebradas</i>,
or ravines, which descend from Pichincha
and other hills, and one of these is arched
over in order to preserve the alignment of the
streets. The city follows the general Latin
American system of town-planning, being laid out
mainly in great rectangular squares, the streets
at right angles to each other. The architectural
type of the houses is that embodying the old
Spanish or Moorish style, well known to the
traveller in Latin America, from Mexico to Peru
or Argentina: the picturesque and often chaste
character of façade (although some may term it
monotonous), with iron grilles before the windows
and high, wide entrance doorway, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">saguan</i>,
admitting a mounted horseman. The main feature
of the house of this type is the interior <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, or
courtyard, upon which the rooms open, often
followed by a second <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>. The material of which
the houses are constructed is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adobe</i>, or sun-dried
earthern brick, which in the dwellings of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
pretension are generally covered with stucco or
plaster, whitened, and at times painted with vivid
colours. Stone is also used. The use of colour,
on the walls of houses in Latin American towns
gives a picturesque appearance at times even to
the meanest <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pueblo</i>, and relieves what might often
be an extreme poverty of appearance. The roofs
of the Quito houses often project over the footpaths,
affording protection from rain, and balconies
overhang from every window.</p>

<p>"The public buildings of Quito are of the
heavy, square, colonial Spanish type. Looking
upon the great square, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza mayor</i>, occupying
the whole of its southern side, is the cathedral,
and on the western side the Government palace,
with a handsome façade, whose main feature is
its long row of columns. On the north side of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> is the palace of the Archbishop, and on
the east the municipal hall. This arrangement,
with some modification, is one encountered in
nearly all Latin American capitals, wherein are
grouped upon the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> the principal edifices of
Church and State, the former taking the place of
honour. The arrangement is generally a pleasing
and useful one. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> is the pulse of the
community, and during those times when the band
plays in its garden it forms a meeting-ground for
the people and the sexes. There are other smaller
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plazas</i> and subsidiary squares in the city, including
those of San Francisco and Santo Domingo. The
many ecclesiastical buildings are an indication of
the part which the Church has played. The finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
building in the city is the Jesuits' church, with
a façade elaborately carved, and the university
occupies part of what formerly was the Jesuit
college. There are eleven monastic institutions,
six of which are nunneries. One of the convents,
that of San Francisco, covers a whole <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cuadra</i> or
block, and takes its place as one of the largest
institutions of this nature in the world. A part
of this great building is in ruins, and another part
has been used for the purpose of a military barracks
by the Government. The university has faculties
of law, medicine and theology&mdash;those three professions
which appeal so strongly to the Latin
American character; but the institution is regarded
as backward, and it has been but poorly
supported.</p>

<p>"The commerce of Quito is small: there is
little produced in so high a region for export.
Superior hand-made carpets are woven, and much
skill is shown in wood-carving and in gold and silver
work. These industries were often characteristic
of the ancient people of America, and weaving
was essentially a widely practised craft among the
Andine races. The beautiful textile fabrics of
the Incas and pre-Incas, some of them probably
thousands of years old, which have been preserved
attest the taste and skill of these people. The
native manufactures of Quito include <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponchos</i>,
blankets, mattings and coarse woollen carpets, also
tanned leather, saddles and shoes. There is a
tendency among all the Andine people to preserve
their interesting home-crafts and cottage industries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
which a wise, economic spirit would endeavour
to assist. But cheap imports menace them.</p>

<p>"The streets of Quito are thronged from morning
to evening with horses, mules, donkeys and
oxen, also llamas, with loads of all kinds, and
ladies in victorias drive about, or to the shops,
which are replete with merchandise from London,
Paris, New York, Vienna or Berlin. Officers in
regimentals and gentlemen in top-hats and frock-coats
are numerous, and Indians with red and
yellow <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponchos</i> and white cotton trousers and hats.
But as regards modern conveniences Quito is
backward, and the lack of hotels and public
hygiene is very serious, and the general conditions
surrounding public health call for urgent improvement."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Ecuadorian "Orient," as the eastern
forested region is termed, is, as has been said, the
third natural division of the country, and a maze
of rivers flow to it from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divortia aquaram</i> of
the Cordillera. The boundary-line with Peru,
Ecuador's neighbour on the south, is in dispute,
notwithstanding arbitration by the King of Spain
in recent years. The relations between the two
nations have been seriously embittered by reason
of this controversy. Ecuador is, in point of population,
the weaker nation: perhaps her claims have
not been considered in a sufficiently generous spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
The law of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uti possidetis</i> alone holds. But an
outlet to the great navigable affluents of the
Amazon is a question of paramount importance
in this forested region, cut off as it is from the
Pacific by the huge rampart of the Andes, and&mdash;without
prejudice to the historical aspects of the
boundary question&mdash;this matter should receive
full consideration. The Orient, although an
undeveloped and little-travelled region at present,
must, in the future, be of great value. Peru
enjoys a vast territory in the same zone, and could
well afford to take a generous outlook upon the
wishes of her neighbour, thereby healing ancient
quarrels and laying the foundation of future international
stability and friendship.</p>

<p>We shall tread this region again in the chapter
dealing with the Amazon.</p>

<p>The upland region of the Cordillera between
Ecuador and Peru, little known to-day, was the
scene of bitter struggles between the Incas&mdash;under
Tupac Yupanqui and his son Huayna Capac, both
famous princes of the Inca dynasty&mdash;and the Shiris,
of the empire or kingdom of Quito, which the
Incas wished to subjugate.</p>

<p>Cacha Duchisela, whose armies had beaten off
the Inca attacks&mdash;he was the fifteenth and last of
the Shiri Kings of Quito&mdash;was rapidly declining
in health.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But his mind did not share the ills
of his body, and he formulated careful plans for
the organization of his forces, which, under Calicuchima,
were carried out. Amid the snowy
heights of Azuay the vanguard of the Puruhaes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
detained for long the onward march of the Inca
forces. But, aided by the Cañaris, the Peruvians
opened a way, and upon the bleak and melancholy
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">páramos</i> of Tiocajas, where years before their
fathers had fought, battle was again waged, and
with the same fatal result for the forces of the
Shiri. Completely defeated, Cacha retired upon
the fortress of Mocha, as his father Hualcopo had
done; but, still more unfortunate, Cacha could
not prevent the advance of the Incas. Having
lost almost all his army, not so much by death as
by desertion and disaffection, Cacha was forced
to abandon the provinces of Mocha, Ambato,
Latacunga, and Quito, which seemed insecure, and
to pass to the northern provinces. Followed by
the Inca, he first fortified himself at Cochasqui
and then at Otalvo.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Here the valiant Caranquis,
who had always been the faithful vassals of the
Shiris, fought with such bravery that from the
defensive the army passed to the offensive, and
the Inca, escaping from an attack, was obliged
to raise the siege of the Caranqui fortress and
to suspend operations. He ordered strongholds to
be made at Pesillo, and turned back to Tomebamba,
with the purpose of calling up from Cuzco
and the other provinces fresh forces of the imperial
troops. In the meantime the Caranquis attacked
and took the Pesillo fortress, and killed its garrison,
an exploit which was at once answered by Huayna
Capac with a strong detachment of soldiers, under
the command of his brother Auqui Toma. Encountering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
no resistance, this general advanced to
Otalvo, but he fell in the first attack. Discouraged
by his death, the Peruvians halted. Huayna Capac
then advanced, bent on vengeance, and the attack
was renewed, but without result. At length by
means of a subterfuge, in which the Incas pretended
to flee and then made a flank attack, the
castle was taken and burnt. The cheated Caranquis
fell confused before the enemy, and only a
captain and a thousand men escaped, taking refuge
in the forests. Cachi fled to the famed Hatuntaqui
fortress, the last hope of his remaining
vassals, and around this stronghold his troops were
concentrated. The Shiri king, notwithstanding his
wasting infirmity, caused his servants to carry him
in his chair to the place of greatest danger in the
combat. The Inca sent him the last invitation to
an honourable surrender, with the hope of avoiding
further bloodshed. Cacha made reply that the
war was not of his seeking, that he was defending
the integrity of his people, and that he would
die before submitting. The attacks continued, and
at first it seemed that the tide of battle might
turn in favour of the Shiri. But these hopes were
vain, for, suddenly struck by a lance, which
penetrated his body, the brave Shiri fell dead in
his chair. Disaster followed: the vanquished
army gave up its weapons and surrendered, proclaiming,
however, at the last moment, upon the
stricken field, the right of accession to kingship
of Paccha, the son of the dead king. But with
the battle of Hatuntaqui fell the dynasty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Shiris, and on the plain which had formed, he
fatal battleground the traveller may observe to-day
the numerous tumuli beneath which repose the
remains of those who once formed the army of
the kingdom of Quito. Thus was played out in
those high regions, overlooked by the Andine
snows and volcanoes, one of those fateful dramas
of early America, analogous in many ways with
the historic struggles of Old World dynasties.</p>

<p>"An incident of Huayna's reign, as concerns
Ecuador, was the rebellion of the Caranquis, who
had accepted the Inca rulers. It was a long and
obstinate conflict to overcome them, but terrible
punishment was meted out. The Inca caused
20,000<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of the rebels to be drowned in a lake,
that of Yahuar-Cocha, whose name means 'the
lake of blood,' which it bears to the present time.
The number given, other writers remark, was
probably that of the combatants who fell on both
sides. When the punitive expedition was accomplished
Huayna returned to Quito, greatly troubled
by the constant insurrections of the various provinces
of the northern empire. There was a
shadow upon the mind of the great Inca ruler,
a portent of some disaster to befall his nation.
These forebodings were later to be realized, for
the caravels of the white man, although at that
moment the Inca did not know it, were about to
traverse the waters of the Pacific upon the coasts
of the empire.</p>

<p>"Huayna Capac doubtless received news of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
earlier arrival of the white men on the Panama
coast of South America, and the matter impressed
him strongly. Tradition states that supernatural
occurrences heralded the fall of the Inca Empire&mdash;flaming
comets, earthquakes, and so forth. On
his deathbed, according to tradition, Huayna
recalled a prognostication that had been earlier
made, that after twelve Incas had reigned&mdash;Huayna
himself was the twelfth&mdash;a valorous race would
appear, a white, bearded people, who would overcome
the empire. 'I go to rest with our father
the Sun,' he added. But it would appear that
the great Inca had not always regarded the sun
as an infallible power. Some years before, at
the great feast of Raymi, the festival of the Sun,
at Cuzco, the chief priest had observed that the
monarch looked up from time to time at the orb
with considerable freedom, an action prohibited and
considered almost sacrilegious; and he inquired,
why the Inca did this. Huayna replied: 'I tell
you that our Father the Sun must have another
lord more powerful than himself; a thing so inquiet
and so bound in his course could not be a god.'
Before he died Huayna Capac admonished his
successor ever to carry on the noble traditions of
their dynasty, in fulfilling their title as 'lovers of
the poor.' Indeed, a civilization and rulers who
had so organized the material resources of the
realm and the life of the community that none
were in want, and where no class oppressed
another, as was indisputably the case under the
Inca Empire, well merited such a title, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the system should have been destroyed by the
ruthless individualism of the Europeans is one of
the most melancholy incidents in history."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These same remote uplands were the scene of
the strenuous march of the Spaniards under
Alvarado (whose earlier adventures we followed
in Mexico), who affected to consider Quito as
outside Pizarro's jurisdiction. Theirs was a dreadful
march. Accustomed to warmer lands, men
and horses starved with cold and famine in the
inclement and foodless Cordillera. They were
forced to eat the bodies of their horses and to boil
herbs in their helmets for food. The march was
made in vain, for Alvarado had been forestalled
by Benalcazar, who, with Almagro, was the real
conqueror of Ecuador.</p>

<p>Ecuador, after the time of Independence, in
which the famous Liberator, Bolivar, figured prominently,
formed part of the republican incorporation
with Columbia and Venezuela. Afterwards
it was subject to revolutionary strife and civil wars
of the most savage and bloodthirsty nature.</p>

<p>Among the leaders of the republican period the
name of Dr. Garcia-Moreno stands forth. It was
a steadfast doctrine of his that political progress
could not be secured whilst widespread poverty
among the people remained&mdash;a doctrine opposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to the merely political ideas of other Presidents of
the Republic, and which indeed is as true to-day
in the Spanish American Republics as it was then.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The antagonisms of the Liberal and clerical elements
at this period brought dreadful excesses in
political life, with assassination and destruction.
The clergy were in a large measure corrupt, their
opponents uncompromisingly hostile, and woe fell
upon the land, and as late as the year 1912 the
most dreadful deeds were committed, and the
future seems to hold little immunity from similar
occurrences.</p>

<p>Our way lies now into Peru. But no highways
unite the two Republics along the almost
inaccessible ranges of the Cordillera; no railways
traverse this wild and broken region between
them, and for a thousand miles the whistle of the
locomotive is unheard among the mountains, whose
solitudes are traversed only by the difficult mule-trail,
over which the hardy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">arriero</i> pursues his
arduous course, or the slow and patient llama,
feeding on the scanty herbage as it goes.</p>

<p>It was in one of the more northern towns of
Peru, that of Cajamarca, that the principal act
of the drama in the downfall of the Inca Empire
took place, and we cannot do less, as we stand
in the plaza of the town, than cast a backward
glance at this page of early American history,
fraught with such changes of destiny to the folk
of the Cordillera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen elsewhere how Pizarro and his
followers painfully made their way along the
South American coast. On September 24, 1532,
they began their march upon Cajamarca, ascending
from the hot coastal lands to the cold regions
of the Andes. Stories had reached them of great,
populous valleys, high up among the clouds which
covered the mountains, of people who had gold
in such profusion that they regarded it as a
commonplace, and made their household utensils
of the yellow metal.</p>

<p>The Inca Empire at that moment was divided
against itself. The two sons of the great Huayna
Capac, Atahualpa and his brother Huascar, were
fighting for the inheritance. Never had the Empire
been divided thus, and its dissension was the
precursor of its fall.</p>

<p>Pizarro sent emissaries before him, and they
found evidence of a remarkable civilization&mdash;in
cut-stone buildings, bridges, and intensive agriculture.
By torture of the Indians, information
was extracted concerning the intentions of Atahualpa,
whose swift messengers had already
apprised the Inca chief of the white man's
arrival on the coast. Atahualpa was crafty and
laid plans for their destruction, but meantime he
sent gifts of llamas and golden cups.</p>

<p>However, the arrival was a peaceful one. The
Spaniards formed camp and arrogantly sent to
summon the Inca to appear before them. Hernando
de Soto, the emissary, found the chief in
the courtyard of his residence&mdash;a part of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
still stands in Cajamarca&mdash;and, riding up to him,
rudely forced his horse in front of Atahualpa, until
the animal's breath fanned his very face.</p>

<p>But the stoic Inca, although he had never beheld
these terrible men-animals, as the Indians termed
the horsemen, before, moved not. He wore the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llauta</i>, a fringe of crimson wool, the emblem of
sovereignty. He vouchsafed no reply at first, but
afterwards professed his friendship, and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chicha</i>, or
native beer, in a golden loving-cup, was brought
forth for the Spaniards' refreshment. Thirty
thousand soldiers with lances surrounded him. At
a word of his the Spaniards might have been
destroyed, or at least driven off.</p>

<p>A careful watch was kept that night in the
Spanish camp. "They are five hundred to one,
comrades," said Pizarro; "but if we must fight
and die, it shall be like Christians, with Providence
on our side." Or such at least is what the
historians have recorded of Pizarro's address; and,
as we have before remarked, the men of Spain,
on occasion, were devout.</p>

<p>The Spanish plan was a surprise attack and to
seize the person of Atahualpa. On the following
day the chief was to return the visit. The Incas
were seen approaching, with bands, dancing, and
singing, adorned with gold and silver; and,
decked in his regal bravery, reclining in his litter,
was the figure of the prince, the last of the Incas.</p>

<p>Whether the intentions of the Peruvians were
hostile or not is doubtful. But the Spaniards saw,
or pretended to see, arms concealed beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
peaceful robes, and they prepared themselves to
make a sudden attack&mdash;to strike the first blow,
after their customarily valiant manner.</p>

<p>It was the hand of the Church that gave the
signal for the onslaught that marked the beginning
of the end of the Incas. The Friar Vicente
Valverde&mdash;chroniclers have acclaimed him as "the
rascally friar"&mdash;advanced, at the instigation of
Pizarro, with a Bible in one hand and a cross in
the other, accompanied by an interpreter, to meet
Atahualpa as he approached, the armed Spaniards
being concealed by the wall of the plaza. "You
must here render tribute and homage to our
Emperor," exclaimed Valverde, "to our Pontiff,
and to the God of the Christians"; and he held
forth the Bible.</p>

<p>The Inca chief took the book, in curiosity
perhaps, probably not understanding what was said.
Opening it, he fingered the pages a moment, and
then haughtily and impatiently threw the book
from him. "Christians!" called out the friar&mdash;and
it is recorded that it was his intention, or that
he had instructions, to break the peace under any
circumstances&mdash;"Christians, I call upon you to
avenge this insult to the faith!"</p>

<p>Atahualpa, suspecting a menace, stood up in
his litter and ordered his soldiers to prepare.
Pizarro and his men grasped their arms and rushed
forth. The trumpets sounded; the mounted
Spaniards rode to the charge; the Indians, stricken
with terror at the sound of the guns, retreated
in panic; and the Christians, falling upon the Inca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
army, triumphed, massacring the Indians like
sheep.</p>

<p>Then they raised their eyes to heaven, giving
thanks for this great victory. The conquest of
Peru was, by this easy victory, already theirs.</p>

<p>The Inca chief had been taken prisoner in the
engagement. He was a man of some thirty years
of age, good-looking, fierce, stoic, a good reasoner
and speaker, and the Spaniards regarded him as
a wise man and treated him well at first.
Probably they felt his superiority over them, these
rude knights of the conquest. Great chiefs came
from all parts of Peru to do him homage in his
captivity. Huascar, his brother, had been murdered,
it is said, by Atahualpa's orders; and
Pizarro was wroth at this occurrence.</p>

<p>The scene changes again. Fearing that, sooner
or later, the white men would kill him, Atahualpa
offered them a princely ransom for his release.</p>

<p>"What ransom can you give?" asked Pizarro,
seeing thereby a means of securing untold gold.
"And when and how can you deliver it?"</p>

<p>The imprisoned chieftain raised his arm to a
white line that ran high around the wall of his
chamber or cell. "I will fill this room up to that
line with gold," he said&mdash;"gold as pots and
vases, gold as nuggets and as dust. I will fill
this room, also, twice over with silver, in addition.
That shall be my ransom, and it shall be completed
in two months' time."</p>

<p>The offer, naturally, was accepted. "Have no
fear," said Pizarro. The Inca sent swift messengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to Cuzco, the capital, hundreds of miles
to the south, along the rugged Cordillera, with
orders that two thousand Indians should bring the
golden vessels from the temples and the palaces.</p>

<p>One of the remarkable institutions of the Inca
Empire was the system of posts, established along
the famous roads. Relays of postmen or runners
were kept stationed at the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tambos</i> or post-houses.
When a message was despatched, the runner ran
his section at full speed, shouting out the message
to the next waiting postman, who immediately proceeded
to cover his stage in the same way; and
thus the message was conveyed with the utmost
speed for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Stores of gold began to arrive&mdash;vases, jars,
pots, some weighing as much as twenty-five pounds
each of the precious metal. The Spaniards one
day saw a remarkable spectacle upon the precipitous
mountain track, on the farther side of the
valley&mdash;a line of golden pots, borne on llamas,
gleaming in the sun, coming to Cajamarca for
the royal ransom.</p>

<p>The promise of the Inca was fulfilled. The
ransom was made good. Did the Spaniards fulfil
their part? For the answer we may point to the
final scene, when Atahualpa, at first condemned
by his captors&mdash;especially the priest&mdash;to be burnt
to death, was strangled, after a mock trial in the
plaza&mdash;infamously done to death, on what was
probably a trumped-up charge of intended
treachery.</p>

<p>The only bright spot on this foul page of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Spanish history is in the circumstance that twelve
of the Spaniards, among them Hernando de Soto,
protested vigorously against the deed. But Pizarro
and the false friar Valverde, and others, were
resolved upon it, and nothing moved them.</p>

<p>Possibly Pizarro, on the day of his own
assassination, nine years afterwards, recalled this
hour. He was killed, whilst at dinner on Sunday,
by the follower of his partner Almagro&mdash;because
he did not keep his promises.</p>

<p>Peru has always appealed to the imagination
by reason of its natural wealth, added
to its mysteries and remoteness. Humboldt spoke
of it as "a beggar sitting upon a heap of gold,"
an aphorism designed to convey the idea of undeveloped
riches. There is scarcely any valuable
or useful product of Nature in the mineral and
vegetable world which we may not find in one or
other of the wide zones of littoral, mountain and
forest of this land; scarcely any potentiality of
life is lacking among her people, could they but
make their way to its enjoyment. Since Humboldt
wrote, much has been done, it is true, but it is
little more than a beginning, in some respects.</p>

<p>If on the coastal zone we remark great tracts
of territory capable of cultivation under irrigation,
so do we find the agricultural resources of the
uplands still calling for development, and mineral
resources still lying unworked in many districts;
whilst in the great Montaña, or region to the east
of the Andes, which occupies the greater part of
the Republic, settlement and cultivation are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
nature only of a few scattered oases in what is
a rich and fertile wilderness.</p>

<p>The uplands of the Andes in Peru contain
some of the most thickly-populated parts of the
country, notwithstanding their considerable elevation.
Here we find capital cities or towns of the
various Departments or States at elevation ranging
from 8,000 to 13,000 feet above the sea, whilst
populous mining centres, such as Cerro de Pasco
and others, are at heights up to 14,000 feet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The people of pure Spanish blood in these
upland communities are few, relatively, for in the
course of time they have become so intermingled
with the original inhabitants that they now form
the real Mestizos, or people of mixed race. But
they are, to all intents and purposes, as much
Spanish Americans as the dwellers of the littoral
provinces, their language being Spanish, and their
customs principally of similar origin. They are
a well-meaning class, desirous of progress and
betterment, but kept backward by the isolation of
their position, and the poverty of the country, and
low standard of living consequent thereon.</p>

<p>"But the main bulk of the population of these
regions is formed by the original people who
constituted the communities of the Inca Empire&mdash;the
Quechuas and Aymaras. Whilst in general
terminology these are called Indians, they must
not be confounded with the savage tribes of the
forest, from which they are distinct in every
respect. They merge into the Cholos, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
an admixture of Spaniard. They have, of
course, absolutely nothing in common with the
imported negroes of the coast, and are not necessarily
dark-skinned&mdash;their complexion sometimes
being relatively light&mdash;although they are beardless.
The hair is worn in a queue. They are strong and
hardy in constitution, and are much sought after
as mining labourers, having a natural aptitude for
this work. The mining regions, in some cases,
are situated at very high elevations, from 11,000
to 17,000 feet, or more, and in the greatly rarefied
air of such altitudes none but the actual sons of
the soil&mdash;who have paid Nature the homage of
being born there&mdash;can endure the hard physical
exertion which mining demands.</p>

<p>"The history of these people is a chequered
and terrible one. At the time of the Inca Empire
they lived in a condition of happy and contented
enjoyment of the fruits of their toil&mdash;a quiet,
pastoral life, ruled by beneficent laws and monarchs
who had their welfare at heart in a manner such
as has never been carried out among the subjects
or citizens of any Christian nation. They inhabited
their glorious uplands, wresting from
Nature, with pleasurable toil, the means of their
simple existence, until&mdash;in the inexplicable plan
of Nature, which ever demands strife and change&mdash;Spaniards
came sailing round the world, and
substituted for that peaceful regime battle and
bloodshed, and long and terrible oppression. A
resulting fear of the invading white man inspired
the distrust which to-day is one of their dominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
characteristics&mdash;Spain's legacy in the Andes.
This has induced a feeling of despair, which is
imprinted on their melancholy countenances, and
in the passive resistance which has become their
habitual attitude towards progress and the administration
of the Republic. But it would not be fair
to cast the onus of this distrust upon the Spaniards
alone, for the Cholos have been abused and
oppressed by the Peruvians of the Republic, almost
up to the present day. In times of revolutionary
war their goods have been commandeered, and
themselves made to serve as soldiers in strife
in which they had no interest, whilst in times of
peace they have been considered an easy subject
for spoliation by the petty authorities and the
wealthier Mestizo class.</p>

<p>"The population of these regions in prehispanic
days was very considerable. The destroying
tendency of the Spanish rule is indicated by the
fact that the Viceroy Toledo, in 1575, numbered
eight million Indians, exclusive of the savages of
the forests, whilst at the close of the Spanish
regime the whole population of the country only
numbered about a million and a quarter. At
present it is calculated that the number of the
Cholo-Indians of the Andine regions is something
under two millions. None of these calculations
is quite reliable, but the fact remains that the
country was well-populated in pre-Colombian
times, and that great destruction took place during
the epoch of Pizarro and the viceroys, whilst
internal feuds and the Chilean War accounted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a great many more deaths. High mortality,
moreover, was brought about from misery and
privation consequent upon wars. To-day the
population tends slowly to increase, but infant
mortality among the Cholos is very heavy, due to
the wretched and insanitary condition of their life,
added to the rigours of the climate on the high
plateaux; which latter, however, would not be an
evil were the standard of life higher.</p>

<p>"The poor Cholo has retained one fortunate
condition from the civilization of his Inca forbears&mdash;he
is an independent landholder. The small
holding, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chacara</i>, which he has wrested from
Nature's chaos of rocks and ravines on the Andine
slopes is his own; no one can dispossess him of
it, and it affords him sufficient crop of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maiz</i>,
potatoes, and, in places, <i>alfalfa</i>, to keep him and
those dependent upon him. He is often, in
addition, the owner of herds of <i>llamas</i>, <i>alpacas</i>,
or sheep and goats, and from their wool he and
his woman spin, and weave with their primitive
looms, the 'tweeds'&mdash;for of this nature is the
native cloth&mdash;and felt hat, which are his garments.
These small holdings have been made in
the most inaccessible places in many cases, by
clearing away rocks and banking up the ground
on the lower side in a similar way to that in
which the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">andenes</i>, or old cultivated terraces of
the Inca period, were formed, and which still
remain and excite the traveller's notice throughout
the whole Andine region.</p>

<p>"Indeed, to the rough, topographical conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and difficult environment of these small holdings
is due the Cholos' undisputed possession, in the
first instance, thereof. Had they existed in more
favourable situations they would have been annexed
long ago, first by the Spanish landholders, and
then by the owners of large <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">haciendas</i> under the
Republic, or taken by the petty authorities under
one or another pretext. It is again an instance
of Nature protecting her progeny against the
ravages of their own kind. The laws of the
Republic now forbid these small holdings to be
alienated from the Cholos; a wise measure,
tending to preserve this useful peasant class.</p>

<p>"The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">andenes</i>, as the terraced fields which cover
the hill-slopes of the Andine region are termed,
are worthy of detailed description. They exist
in almost every valley, extending upwards from
the coast and the foothills to elevations of 12,000
feet, and even 16,000 feet or more, covering the
slopes even in the most inaccessible situations and
rigorous altitudes. From some high saddle or
summit whence the surrounding horizon is visible,
the observer notes a curious chequered or rippled
appearance upon the flanks of the ridges, as far
as the eye can reach, from the floor of the valleys
up to the precipitous rock escarpments. They are
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">andenes</i>; small terraces, one after the other,
embanked on the lower sides with stone walls,
like a series of irregular steps, where the soil has
been collected and cultivated. The great number
of these small holdings in every direction throughout
the Peruvian Sierra has given rise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
supposition that a numerous population inhabited
the Andes in prehistoric times&mdash;estimates even of
ninety million inhabitants having been made. But
this is fabulous, although it is evident that a
numerous people must have formed and cultivated
these remarkable terraces, of whom the present
population are only a residue.</p>

<p>"Adjacent to these valleys, especially in certain
districts, as upon the Upper Marañon,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> are groups
of extensive ruins of habitations, as well as of
burying-places, known as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">huacas</i>&mdash;often containing
mummies&mdash;and of castles and fortresses. These
latter often command the heads of valleys and
defiles, and they go to show that the former inhabitants
must have dwelt as separate groups or
communities under the leadership of some chief&mdash;probably
in pre-Inca times. These <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">andenes</i>, as
the Spaniards termed the terraces when they
conquered Peru, may have given rise, it has been
surmised, to the name of the Andes; but this
probably is not correct, the real derivation undoubtedly
coming from the name of the <i>Antis</i>&mdash;a
tribe which inhabited the snow-covered Cordillera
region, which was termed by the Incas <i>Ant-isuyu</i>.
This name, in Quechua, signifies 'copper-bearing,'
and copper was extensively used by the Incas.</p>

<p>"The Cholo, then, provides for his wants, and
he is quite independent&mdash;when allowed to be so&mdash;of
the governing race. He asks nothing from
civilization, and indeed this has, so far, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
him mainly two things&mdash;the superstitious part of
the Roman Catholic religion, and alcohol! The
one has partly improved his mind&mdash;the other tends
to ruin his body.</p>

<p>"At Fair times, and on the numerous Church
feast-days, the Cholos and their women flock into
the towns to buy, sell, drink and indulge in
religious exercises. With their bright-hued
blankets and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponchos</i>&mdash;generally made by themselves&mdash;they
lend colour and interest to the scene.
And the priests&mdash;ha! the priests!&mdash;this is the time
of their harvest, and the Cholos are the inexhaustible
supply whence they draw fees, tithes
and offerings. For the Cholo nature has been
most susceptible to the rites and representations
with which Roman Catholicism is interpreted
among them. They all bear Spanish names&mdash;Christian
and surname&mdash;and each has his patron
saint: and they must be considered a civilized
race.</p>

<p>"As stated, these people are the descendants
of the Incas, or rather of the Quechuas and
Aymaras, who formed the population of the
Inca Empire, for of the Inca line there are no
descendants whatever left. The Incas were a
royal line, and whilst their members were more
or less numerous, owing to the polygamy customary
to them, the irregular descendants were not
recognized as legitimate Incas, the real line of
succession having been preserved by the progeny
of the marriage of the reigning Inca with his own
sister. The illegitimate offspring naturally intermarried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with the common people, and were merged
into these again. Elsewhere some particulars
of the past history and conditions of the Incas,
and the population under their rule, have been
described, as also their structures&mdash;temples, palaces
and habitations&mdash;the ruins of which are encountered
to-day along these vast uplands, where the Cholo
feeds his flock, and lives his remote and melancholy
existence. In marked contrast are some of these
beautiful ruins to the wretched habitations of the
present occupiers of the land.</p>

<p>"The Cholo-Indians of the uplands are, then,
miners, shepherds and agriculturists. In tending
their flocks, and in the breeding and domestication
of the <i>llama</i>, they are remarkably expert, and their
patience and endurance arouse the interest of the
traveller who sojourns among them. They have
many good qualities, which have been unable yet
to expand. The true policy of the administrations
which govern them must be towards bettering
them and causing them to multiply, for, apart
from motives of humanity, they are one of the
country's most valuable human assets. If they
fail, and become exterminated, a large part of
the uplands and higher valleys of the Andes would
become an uninhabited desert, for it is doubtful
if any other race could ever occupy their place,
or perform manual labour at the great elevations
which form their habitat.</p>

<p>"Let us now glance at the conditions of life
in some of the principal towns of this region of
the Sierra. As is but natural, the farther these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
communities are removed from the coast, the
more primitive does their mode of life become.
When the only means of communication with the
outside world are by difficult and sometimes dangerous
mule-roads, journeys are undertaken but
rarely, and new influences, objects and appliances
are not easily forthcoming. Yet in some cases
demand is met by supply, and in spite of the
difficulty of conveyance of heavy goods; pianos,
billiard-tables and such things are constantly met
with in the houses and restaurants of the large
towns in the inter-Andine region. But books,
pictures and other essentials of refined life are
scarce.</p>

<p>"What is the aspect of these towns? Imagine
yourself astride your mule upon the summit of
the range which bounds one of these Andine
valleys. You have toiled on all day, saddle-galled
and weary, and you gladly direct your gaze to
where the town lies spread below&mdash;a bird's-eye
view. The streets run at right angles, with a
central <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> containing the cathedral or church,
and official buildings; the hotel&mdash;if there be one
at this particular place&mdash;and various shops and
houses. The cultivated plain surrounds it&mdash;the
'flat place' which Nature has provided, and which,
together with the river which intersects it, is the
reason of man's habitation there at all. For it
is early impressed upon the traveller in the Andes
that 'flat places' are a prime requisite for
humanity's existence. You begin the descent,
having seen that the crupper of your mule is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
place, in order that you may not journey upon
the animal's neck; whilst your <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">arriero</i> tightens the
pack-mule's girths. Small <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chacaras</i>, or holdings,
with little tumble-down stone huts, grass-roofed,
straggle up the hillside, and bare-legged, unwashed
children rush out among your animal's legs&mdash;the
progeny of unkempt Cholo peasant women, at work
within upon the preparation of some primitive meal.
The little holdings are surrounded by rude stone
walls, or hedges of prickly-pear, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maguey</i>
(agave). Still you descend. The huts give place
to adobe houses, with whitewashed walls and red-tiled
or grass-thatched roofs; the straggling trail
forms itself more into the semblance of a street;
your beast's hoofs rattle over the cobble pavement;
some few inhabitants stand at their doors to stare
and remark at the advent of a stranger; and in a
moment you have entered the <i>plaza</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="peruvian" id="peruvian"></a>

</div>

<p>"The condition of the <i>plaza</i>, in Spanish
American cities, is an index of the prosperity and
enterprise of the particular community. In the
more wealthy and advanced towns it is well paved,
and planted with shrubs and flowers, and a band,
during several evenings of the week, discourses
music therein, to the delight of the populace.
Here pretty girls and amorous youths promenade&mdash;the
only means of exercise the former are permitted,
and the only general meeting-ground of
the two sexes. In the interior towns of Peru the
<i>plaza</i> is often grass-grown and unpaved. It seems
to reflect the poverty of its inhabitants, and to
impress upon the foreigner that the country is but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
slowly recovering from the misfortunes of its
troubled history. The traveller, accustomed to the
movement and modernness of the cities of other
lands, will observe the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">triste</i> aspect of the place
with dismay, and wish he might turn his horse's
head again without delay towards the coast and
civilization. But the more leisurely observer will
not fail to find much that is interesting even here.
The buildings are quaint; the air of mediaeval
times which shrouds the grass-grown <i>plaza</i> and the
half-ruined church, together with the strange garb
of the Indians who slink through the streets, and
the struggling evidences of modern civilization&mdash;in
shop sign or municipal notice&mdash;are almost
pathetic. Whatever it is, it is peaceful; the
climate is bracing, the cost of living&mdash;to foreign
eyes&mdash;<em>nil</em>; and do not the surrounding hills and
valleys contain unknown possibilities of mineral
and industrial wealth?</p>

<p>"The society of these places consists of the
official element&mdash;the prefect and other functionaries,
and few professional men; the few storekeepers,
and the chief landowners of the
neighbourhood. There is but little social life&mdash;an
occasional <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">baile</i>, a few political meetings, and
the Sunday morning Mass. At the latter, the
young men of the place foregather at the church
door, what time the devout <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> come forth,
and pass review of soft faces and flashing eyes,
beneath shady mantillas. There is probably a
club with billiard-tables, brought with difficulty
over mountain roads, as before mentioned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
newspapers of somewhat remote date. But the
chief centres for gossip-mongers are the stores,
and shops where <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">copitas</i> of brandy and native
spirits are sold.</p>

<p>"The great merry-making period of the year
is that of the three days' carnival celebration.
During this time business is entirely suspended,
and the whole population&mdash;whether in Lima and
other coast cities, the towns of the Andes, or the
remote hamlets of the plateaux&mdash;give themselves
over to frenzied play. This consists principally
in bombarding each other from the balconies of
the houses with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">globos</i>, or india-rubber bladders
full of water; squirts, scents, powder and other
matters. It is impossible to pass along the streets
during these three days' riotous play without being
soaked or covered with flour or powder from above,
and the only method is either to enter into the
sport, or else lie low at home until it is over. The
usual reserve between the sexes is much broken
down at this time, and the warm-blooded Peruvian
girl enters with much zest into the temporary licence
of Carnival.</p>

<p>"The houses of the upland towns are generally
built of adobe or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tapiales</i>&mdash;that is, of bricks or
concrete made of wet earth, sun-dried and
whitened&mdash;the roofs being covered with red pantiles,
or thatched with grass. Through the wide
entrance door access is gained to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, or
interior paved yard, after the usual Spanish American
style, upon which the various rooms look and
open. The windows upon the street are all securely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
barred with iron <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rejas</i>, or grilles, and the whole
aspect is quaint and mediaeval, though the arrangement
lacks in comfort from the foreigner's point
of view; whilst the interior <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</i> is naturally
of a nature more primitive than that of communities
in European towns. But in general, the peoples
of these regions dwell in sufficiency, and that acute
poverty, as among the lower strata of foreign cities,
does not exist in Peru.</p>

<p>"The ultimate and irrevocable line of caste distinction
in these places is that between the coat
and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poncho</i>. From the prefect and the lawyer
and the doctor, down to the shop assistant, the
dress is the coat of the ordinary European form.
Be there but the smallest recognized strain of
European blood in the individual, it will be
sheltered by the coat, but below this all is ignorance
and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poncho</i>. This useful but uncivilized
garment consists of a species of blanket with an
opening in the centre by which it is slipped over
the head. We must, however, temper this 'clothes&mdash;philosophy'
by remarking that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poncho</i> is used
even by <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballeros</i> on certain occasions, especially
on horseback, when, in the form of a thin white
material, it wards off the sun's rays and protects
the horseman from dust, whilst as a thick woollen
garment it shields him from the bitter blasts and
keen air of the mountain uplands. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponchos</i>
woven of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">vicuña</i> wool by the Cholos are of the
most exquisite texture, and practically, waterproof.
But the ordinary blanket <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poncho</i> is the
poor Indian's greatest possession. It shelters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
him by day from the sun or rain, and at night
it forms his bed.</p>

<p>"The advent of a foreigner in these more remote
places is a matter of interest to the inhabitants,
and&mdash;especially if he be a person bent upon some
scientific or exploratory work&mdash;he is well and hospitably
received, and all facilities afforded to him.
Keen interest is taken in anything pertaining to
the outside world, for these people, cut off as
they are by natural barriers from its happenings,
are far from being apathetic, or indifferent of
events. Indeed it is this eager interest and
avidity for knowledge of the modern world which
most greatly touches the sympathy of the traveller,
and which is the element which must redeem the
people of these remote places from stagnation and
decadence.</p>

<p>"Peruvian hospitality is proverbial, and nowhere
is it stronger than among the peoples of the upper
class in the Sierra. The traveller soon becomes
the centre of a group who press their not unwelcome
attentions upon him; and they provide
the best their houses afford for his refreshment
and entertainment, as a rule accepting nothing in
payment. This pleasing quality, in addition to
being born of their native kindness, is motived
partly from the desire to be considered civilized,
and this is not without a note of pathos. The
traveller, moreover, will not fail to recollect that
he has sojourned in other&mdash;business&mdash;communities,
whose higher civilization certainly does not necessarily
include hospitality. These Sierra people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Peru, whilst they possess pleasing traits of the above
nature, have also others less happy. They, as a
class, are sometimes unscrupulous in their business
dealings, and agreements are not always to be relied
upon&mdash;a defect of the Spanish American generally,
which at times overshadows his better qualities."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have already remarked on the mineral
resources of the Andine region of Peru. It may
be that, in the future, attention will be more widely
directed thereto, and travellers with technical
knowledge of mining are increasingly making their
way here, and some notes on this score are of
interest. Little, however, seems possible in this
field without the use of foreign capital.</p>

<p>In a land so famous for its gold as was that
of Old Peru, it is remarkable that so little gold is
produced at the present time&mdash;an insignificant
annual amount of little over £100,000. Yet there
are many gold-bearing deposits scattered over the
vast upland region, from auriferous quartz-seams:
to vast gravel deposits. There do not appear to
be any huge ore-bodies of the nature of South
Africa, with low-grade but abundant material. The
seams, however, in many cases offer "payable
propositions." There are rock ledges of great
length and depth, capable of being worked economically
by adits rather than shafts, and sometimes
with water-power available and with "cheap
mining labour" (that attractive item of the
company-promoter's prospectus) at hand, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
immediate areas of fertile land for the needful
foodstuffs. A difficult feature sometimes is the
matter of transport, for, from the coast, the
Cordillera must be surmounted.</p>

<p>The enormous gold-bearing alluvial deposits are
generally situated on the most westerly side or
summits of the Cordillera, and in the Montaña,
and are difficult of access at present in the absence
of railways. Various enterprises have been set on
foot to win the gold from these in recent years&mdash;whether
by the method of dredging, whether after
the Californian "hydraulic" system&mdash;but it is
doubtful if they have proved a success, from a
variety of causes. There, however, is the gold,
awaiting recovery.</p>

<p>The reputation for fabulous wealth of silver in
the Peruvian mountains has passed into a proverb.
Great wealth has been recovered, and the ores
are often extremely rich. Myriads of old workings
exist, which were abandoned because the more
primitive appliances of a past age did not permit
the drainage of the mines, which became filled
with water; but they are capable of being pumped
out. Romantic tales are told of the enrichment
of miners who persevered in their labours in some
lonely mine and won great fortune. In the many
examinations I made here of gold and silver mines
in Peru there were found conditions that should
well repay modern mining enterprise. There is,
of course, a good deal of work being carried on.</p>

<p>The great wealth of copper, lead, zinc, quicksilver,
iron and coal also present their attractions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and there are rarer metals whose use commerce
urgently requires. But foreign capital does not
flow very freely to Peru, and Peruvian capital does
not seem to have the organizing faculty to develop
the mineral wealth of the country for itself. The
mining laws of Peru offer considerable privileges
to the foreigner, whom the Government is ever
desirous of encouraging.</p>

<p>The Indian, the native miner, has his own
methods of winning the gold from the rocks and
gravels, or the gold-bearing streams of the Montaña,
or the auriferous earths of the high pampas.
In the streams he selects a suitable spot and paves
it with large stones. Then, when the floods pass
over the prepared surface of rude "riffles," the
gold carried down by the waters from the auriferous
rocks lodges in the interstices, and, removing the
stones, he recovers the precious nuggets and dust.
Or, by laborious panning in a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">batea</i>, or wooden
bowl, hollowed out of a block of wood, he washes
the gravel from the rich banks of sediment, and
the gold lies at the bottom. In the case of the
gold-bearing ores, he digs shallow pits in the
surface of the ledge, where Nature, under the oxidation
of the pyrites, has transformed the gold
into a form recoverable by the simple method of
amalgamation with quicksilver, after crushing the
friable quartz under a primitive rocking-stone.</p>

<p>Indeed, in many places, it would seem that
Nature has placed the gold here in a form such
that recovery will remunerate the natural son of
the soil, when a more greedy and better-equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
"company" would be unable to pay its way. The
stores of gold possessed by the Incas of Peru were
won by such primitive methods; large bodies of
Indians being employed upon the work, and
evidences of their operations remain to the present
time.</p>

<p>The ancient folk of the Andes had as their
greatest food products maiz, millet and potatoes,
together with the numerous tropical fruits of the
lowlands. They gave Europe the potato&mdash;surely
no inconsiderable gift&mdash;having developed it in
Ecuador, Peru and Chile, from the wild, bitter
variety; and Europe gave them wheat and other
cereals, and, of course, the domestic animals&mdash;ox,
cow, sheep, horse and pig.</p>

<p>The llama was their only beast of burden here&mdash;this
curious, hoofed, ruminating quadruped of the
camel tribe, with its long neck and timid face.
In our journeys along these bleak uplands we shall
meet large droves of the llamas, bearing loads
of merchandise, in weight up to a hundred pounds.
These animals are sagacious in their way, and if
overloaded refuse to move. Their services, their
wool, their flesh, are all extremely valuable adjuncts
of Indian life. The creature costs little or nothing
to keep: it requires no shelter, and it feeds itself
as it goes along, at a rate of about four miles an
hour. The llama indeed was&mdash;and is&mdash;an outstanding
figure in the native economics of the
Peruvian and Bolivian Andes. Its cousin the
alpaca is also to be seen in large bands.</p>

<p>Up to the limit of the temperate zone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Peruvian Andes, about 11,500 feet, we shall remark
some of the familiar flora of England, such
as ferns, nettles, buttercups, violets and stitchwort,
together with wild geraniums and pelargoniums.
Apples, pears, cherries and strawberries also grow,
under desultory cultivation. Trees are scant in
the almost treeless Andes, and we find little beyond
the groves of stunted <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quinua</i> and other native
shrubs, which, however, are valuable for fuel. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ichu</i> grass&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">stipa Incana</i>&mdash;which also serves for
"thatching" the Indian huts, is the predominant
herbage.</p>

<p>As we ascend, the vegetation becomes even more
humble. At 13,500 feet the potato will not grow;
the hardy barley will not yield. Only a few thorny
shrubs and some curious cacti are to be seen.
Higher still we reach the limit of the perpetual
snow, where little but the lichens and a few
cryptogams appear, except a few cold-resisting
flowers having medicinal properties. Above, all
is bare, the inorganic world asserts its kingdom&mdash;except
for the condor of the Andes circling around
the summit of some ice-covered volcano.</p>

<p>Here in these high, inclement uplands, I have
pitched my tent, and my Indians are now preparing
a meal around the camp-fire, made of the dry
grass or some scanty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">leña</i> or firewood, or possibly
we may have come across a "colony" of the
curious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yareta</i>, a huge mushroom-like woody
growth, perhaps three feet in diameter, full of resin,
which burns fiercely: a product only of the
Peruvian and Bolivian heights. Failing these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
matters, the fire must be of dry llama dung,
or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">taquia</i>, a useful fuel in the Andes, from
which even the ores of silver, in places, are
smelted.</p>

<p>Here on the roof of the world we mark the
rays of the setting sun tinting a rosy red the eternal
pinnacles of the Andes, and the last glow gone,
we must seek the tent and draw the ponchos about
us; the Indians throwing themselves upon the
ground outside. Simple and faithful souls are these
children of the uplands, full of gratitude to the
<i>patron</i> who treats them fairly; resourceful and industrious.
And the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ingles</i>, of course, treat them
well and justly. Is not an Englishman's word
his bond? Further, are not his pockets invariably
lined with silver! Months have I spent in these
wilds, without any other companions than the
Quechua Indians and the Cholos, our only language
Spanish and what smattering of Quechua it was
possible for me to acquire.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I have formed camp in some
abandoned Inca ruins, and the evening meal has
been cooked in the ruined stone fireplace of folk
departed these many centuries: my seat a cube of
stone neatly fashioned&mdash;one of those which strew
the ground around&mdash;by some ancient mason.
There one may ponder upon the strange folk, who
built massive temples and megalithic walls&mdash;in a
region where there is no timber and where corn
does not grow. Why did these folk establish themselves
in these high places? Are there any other
mountains in the world where Nature brought forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a dominating culture so near the clouds as that
whose progenitors went forth, as we are told, from
the mysterious island of Titicaca?</p>

<p>Or again, night has overtaken us on the edge
of the Montaña, and, below, we overlook the tree-filled
valleys, part of the forest which stretches
unbroken for thousands of miles across the
Amazon plains of Brazil. The valley may be
filled with mist, and the effect is remarkable, as
a weird transformation scene. The sun sets; it
still tinges the western sky with its beauteous and
indescribable tints. The palest saffron fades into
the pearly-green of the zenith, and the last, orange
rays, calm and cold, flash faintly and expiringly
upwards. In the deep cañons the fleecy masses of
pearly vapour slowly pour&mdash;"slow, lingering up the
hills like living things." So soft and pure are they
that they might be the couch spread for some
invisible god-traveller! No eye but mine beholds
them. The Indians are busy at the camp-fire.
Then the mist masses arise as if to engulf the
lonely headland on which we stand, like awful
billows. But the light fades, except that of a
single jewelled planet, which gleams softly and
protectingly down from its gathering height.</p>

<p>The Indians sustain themselves at times on their
journeys by chewing the leaves of the <i>coca</i> shrub,
which are a valued possession among them. This
shrub, peculiar to Peru and Bolivia&mdash;although it
has now been transplanted to Ceylon&mdash;is that which
gives us the cocaine of the pharmacop&oelig;ia. For
the invaluable quinine, we may also be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
grateful to Peru and to the memory of that
viceroy's lady, the Countess of Chinchon, who,
sick of a fever&mdash;it was <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tercianas</i> or tertial malaria&mdash;was
cured by an Indian woman with doses of
the steeped bark of the quinine shrub, which bears
her name to this day.</p>

<p>The most ancient and remarkable town of the
Cordillera is Cuzco, the one-time Inca capital. It
lies in a valley, overlooked by lofty mountains; and
on its northern side stands the famous fortress
of Sacsaihuaman, the cyclopean fortress of the early
Peruvians&mdash;the Incas and their predecessors. Here
we may stand upon the great walls of what is
one of the most remarkable of prehistoric structures,
forming terraces along the hillside of great
stone blocks, built in the form of revetments and
salients, some of the stones being nearly twenty
feet high.</p>

<p>Many of the walls of the Cuzco streets still
retain their Inca stone construction, a monument
to the clever masonry of these people, which has
excited the interest and admiration of many archæologists
and travellers. Here was the Temple of
the Sun, and indeed part of its beautifully moulded
walls still remains.</p>

<p>The town is the centre of one of the most popular
districts of Peru, labouring Indians mainly; and
it has a number of interesting Spanish colonial
buildings, with some textile and other industries.
We may reach Cuzco now by rail from Arequipa
and the coast at Mollendo. Not far away are others
of the remarkable remains of early Peruvian civilization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
including the Inca "astronomical observatory"
of Intihuatana, where the priests determine
the solstices by means of the shadow
cast by a stone column, a portion of which
still exists. Also Ollanta.</p>

<p>Cuzco witnessed the final overthrow of the Incas
after the scene at Cajamarca, and many excesses
were committed here by the Spaniards, in their
purpose of stamping out the early Peruvian
civilization&mdash;a sad and pathetic page of history
indeed.</p>

<p>If on these high and often dreary uplands it
was destined that the power of the Inca Empire
should pass away in so melancholy a fashion, it
would seem that fate had here a similar end for
the empire of its conquerors in store. For are not
the fateful names of Junin and Ayacucho stamped
upon the face of this Cordillera region? Here the
Royalists of Spain made their last stand.</p>

<p>We cannot enter upon the details of Spain's
downfall. From its history stand out the famous
names of San Martin, with his march across the
Andes from Argentine into Chile; Bolivar, and
his equally or more renowned march across the
Northern Andes; Cochrane, the English admiral,
and his operations on the coast; Sucre, La Serna,
and others. At the Battle of Junin the Royalist
leader of the Spanish forces was defeated. Cuzco,
the last stronghold of Spain in South America, fell.
Then came the historic Battle of Ayacucho. The
patriots&mdash;Peruvians, Chileans and some Argentines&mdash;numbered
some six thousand; the Royalists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
nine thousand. The Royalists were utterly routed,
fifteen hundred were slain: the viceroy, his
generals, officers and army were captured. It was
hailed as a providential victory for freedom; a
new life after three hundred years of Spanish
domination, and the colours of Iberia flew no more
upon the Cordillera.</p>

<h3>THE CORDILLERA OF THE ANDES</h3>

<h4>IN BOLIVIA, CHILE AND ARGENTINA</h4>


<p>Still threading the high region of the Andes,
our journey takes us into Bolivia, that comparatively
little-known Republic.</p>

<p>Neither topographically nor historically is there
any marked change from Peru to Bolivia. Both
countries occupy the "roof of the world" here,
the chain and uplands of the Cordillera, although,
if such were possible, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">punas</i>, or steppes, of
Bolivia are even more inclement than the corresponding
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">antiplanicies</i> of Peru.</p>

<p>Bolivia has, indeed, been termed the Tibet of
America, where the yak is replaced by the llama.
But it would be unjust to compare the one with
the other as regards the human element, for the
Andine Republic is peopled, or at least administered
and animated, by the sensitive and progressive
Spanish American civilization, and is not an old
or decadent land, but, on the contrary, has all its
life before it.</p>

<p>The highlands, we have said, are a continuation
of those of Peru. In both countries, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
as in Northern Chile, we shall remark on our
mountain expedition the herds of beautiful vicuña,
fleet as the wind, living where nothing else will
live, yielding a soft, tawny fur or skin, a boa
of which is indeed a comforter around one's neck
as a protection against the keen air of the heights.
In the ramparts of the rocks myriads of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">viscachas</i>
squirrels, or rather conies, have their home, and
it is a swift shot that will secure one for the
evening meal.</p>

<p>Of the stupendous snowy peaks of Bolivia we
have already spoken. There arise Sorata and
Illimani, highest&mdash;with Huascaran and Coropuna,
in Peru, and Aconcagua, in Chile, all near or over
23,000 feet&mdash;on the American Continent. Few
travellers approach or ascend these mountains,
whose beauties the inhabitants themselves generally
prefer to contemplate from afar.</p>

<p>Bolivia is generally regarded as a "mountain
republic," remote, inaccessible, backward. Such
a concept requires some modification. It is true
that the country, deprived of its seaboard, has its
population and centres of life mainly upon the
Andes, that its population is relatively small in
comparison with those of its neighbours, and consists
to a larger degree of the Indian element.
But it is not all mountain, nor all Indian folk.
A considerable area of the Republic extends to
the lowlands of the Amazon Valley (and to the
Plate), including those delightful sub-valleys and
hill-slopes which Nature, by reason of climate and
vegetation, has rendered of the most pleasant. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
for the people, we find here the same Spanish
American civilization, among the cultured class
that is, with the traits and gifts common to their
race. As for the Indian&mdash;that is their social
problem.</p>

<p>La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, to which we may
have ascended by rail from the coast, is approached
almost unawares. There is nothing to foretell,
as we cross the barren plains from Viacha, that
so important a place will shortly be displayed
to the view. Suddenly we reach the Alto, or
"Height," and there, far below, is La Paz, reposing
in the mighty amphitheatre of its abrupt valley.
Before the train descends from the verge it is well
to look again upon Illimani, Huayna-Potosi, and
another giant, Mururata, whose snowy peaks reflect
the colour of the sunset, bathed in an atmosphere
so limpid that their distant slopes are brought to
deceptive nearness.</p>

<p>The Valley of La Paz has the aspect of a vast
crater, its floor lying over 12,000 feet above sea-level.
Its buildings and institutions merit the
traveller's attention. Its pleasing alameda and
other planted or cultivated areas are a relief after
the dreary and forbidding aspect of the valley
around, with its scarred and precipitous sides.
Who could have founded a city here, and why?</p>

<p>La Paz was founded by Alonzo de Mendoza in
1548, and first named to commemorate the
temporary reconciliation between Pizarro and
Almagro, who had grievously quarrelled. The
cathedral was begun in the seventeenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
when the famous mines of Potosi were at their
height of productiveness. Some of the streets are
of the most winding character possible, and many
of them reflect the poverty of their Indian dwellers.
Others are full of animation, constantly threaded
by caravans of llamas, asses and mules, and
thronged by a many-hued population of pure-blooded
Indians, with garments negligent but picturesque;
Cholas, or half-breed women, often
extremely pretty, dressed in vivid colours,
coquettish, wearing their home-made hats of white
felt; and townsmen of white race, ladies of La
Paz, and European folk: in brief, all the
elements we shall have seen in the upland towns
of Spanish America, where rich and poor do congregate
together. On Sundays the animation increases,
for this is the day of markets, and piles
of wares and fruits and other products interest
and attract. The streets are electrically lit. In
the new part of the city are many handsome residences
and evidences of wealth. The inevitable
band in the plaza discourses its music, and the
churches command their usual congregations. The
museums&mdash;mining and archæological&mdash;show a
regard for science here. La Paz is now becoming
a comparatively cosmopolitan centre, and its
interest and importance most undoubtedly increase.</p>

<p>The Republic of Bolivia took its name, as a
token of gratitude, from Bolivar, the great
Liberator. Since his time, from 1825 to 1913,
it has had seventy-one different presidents, an
average of a little over one per annum, an indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
either of an experimental outlook towards self-government
or of chronic unrest, whichever way
we may prefer to view it. It is difficult for a
European to comprehend the disabilities and
difficulties of such a community, and criticism is
easy. But we may again reflect that their future
lies before these remote States, and that their
human vitality and natural resource are storehouses
for the future, not depleted or derelict.</p>

<p>To the observant foreigner perhaps the most
interesting human element in the Andes is that
of the Indians. They are the true children of
the soil, Nature's product unadulterated, the
specimen of her human handiwork in this special
environment. They hide nothing, they expect
nothing from her. But if the future lies before
them they are nevertheless obsessed with their past.
They are a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">raza conquistada</i> as their masters term
them&mdash;a conquered race. They may not always be
so. Different writers take different views of them.</p>

<p>In Peru the natives of these uplands are the
Quechuas; in Bolivia, the Quechuas and the
Aymaras. These two differ somewhat in their
habits and temperament. There are, in addition,
a number of savage tribes, mostly in the forested
regions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Aymaras, one of the principal ethnical
elements of the Bolivian nation, are found in the
north, as far as Peruvian territory, on the banks,
islands and peninsulas of Lake Titicaca, and
on the plateau as far south as Oruro. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Quechuas occupy the south and the north of the
Argentine.</p>

<p>"Between these two races there is a difference
of type and a greater difference of character. The
Aymara is a little above the average height, has
the chest strongly developed, the calves powerful,
and the feet small. The features are not on the
whole attractive; they are prominent, and indicative
neither of intelligence nor goodwill. The
head is large, the neck short and thick, the cheeks
wide, the nose massive; the eyes are small, the
mouth wide, and the lips thick. The colour is
coppery or an olive-brown, varying with the altitude.
The hair is black, thick and strong, but
the beard is absolutely lacking.</p>

<p>"While the Quechua is docile, submissive and
obedient, the Aymara is hard, vindictive, bellicose,
rebellious, egotistical, cruel and jealous of his
liberty; he is always ready to resort to force.
In times of disturbance the factions have always
recruited the bulk of their fighters from the
Aymaras. Yet they seem lacking in will, except
the will to hate all that is unlike themselves. The
Aymara is also fanatical, and his is not the fanaticism
of religion, but of vanity; he wants to cut
a figure in the religious fêtes, which are not unlike
orgies of idolatry, and are marked by alcoholic
and moral excesses of every kind.</p>

<p>"The plateaux are always cool, so the Aymara
wears a comparatively warm costume, consisting
of a thick woollen shirt and a poncho of many
colours, with dark, narrow breeches coming just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
below the knee. The legs are bare, and the feet
equally so, or are shod with sandals of raw hide.
The Aymara, like the Tibetan, another dweller
in plateaux, is insensible to cold; he sleeps bare-footed
in the hardest frosts, and walks through
freezing water or over ice without apparent inconvenience.
On days of festival the Aymara
replaces the poncho by a sort of tight-fitting tunic.
The head is well covered with a large woollen
bonnet, which protects the neck and ears. The
women also wear a shirt or chemise of thick wool
or cotton, over which they throw a mantle of
coarse, heavy wool, striped with bright colours,
and retained on the chest by a sort of spoon of
silver or copper, the slender handle serving as
a pin. A heavy woolle petticoat, pleated in front,
and usually dyed a dark blue, covers the lower
part of the body to the ankles. The Aymara
woman wears several of these petticoats superimposed,
which gives her a very bulky look about
the hips. A somewhat unattractive hat completes
the costume. Men and women alike having a
perfect contempt for hygiene, all parts of the body
are coated with a respectable layer of dirt. Their
clothes, which they never put off, even to sleep, are
worn until they fall into tatters, and usually give
off a disagreeable ammoniacal odour.</p>

<p>"The Aymara tongue differs from the Quechua;
it is a harsh, guttural idiom, rather formless, but
having conjugations. It is forcible and concise.
The peoples conquered by the Quechuas learned
the language of their conquerors; but the Aymaras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
retained theirs, and when the Spaniards conquered
the country, the Aymaras, who had long been a
subject race, were decadent and diminishing in
numbers.</p>

<p>"By the innumerable vestiges of building and
the tombs near Lake Titicaca we may judge that
this country was once thickly populated. But the
plains afforded no refuge, and the inhabitants could
not escape the forced recruiting which supplied the
mining centres. At the time of Tupac-Amaru's
insurrection the Aymaras, happy to reconquer
their liberty, or perhaps merely to effect a change
of masters and to satisfy their bellicose instincts,
threw themselves into the revolt; whereupon war,
sickness and famine considerably reduced their
numbers. To-day they are estimated to be about
400,000 strong.</p>

<p>"The Aymaras are divided into six tribes,
according to the regions they inhabit. These are
the Omasuyos, the Pacasas, the Sicasicas, the
Larecajas, the Carangas, and the Yungas. The
Aymaras of the provinces of Yungas, Larecaja,
and Muñecas are lighter in tint, cleaner, more intelligent
and less uncouth than the rest.</p>

<p>"The Quechua race, whose numbers are
greater, are found in many regions of Bolivia.
The Quechua is lighter and yellower than the
Aymara, and more of a Mongolian type. The
features are irregular, the eyes black, the cheek-bones
prominent; the narrow forehead is slightly
protuberant, and the skull oblong; the mouth is
wide and the nose massive. The stature is rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
below the average, but there are tall individuals,
who as a rule resemble the Aymara type. Solidly
built, the Quechua looks a powerful and muscular
man; but as from childhood both sexes are used
to carrying extremely heavy burdens on the back
they are not really very strong in the limbs,
although the shoulders are very powerful. The
Indian is an extraordinary walker; his legs of
steel enable him to travel long distances in mountainous
regions without the least fatigue. The
women are even stronger than the men, their work
being heavier, although they live practically the
same life.</p>

<p>"The Quechua costume consists of a coloured
poncho, a tight woollen vest, and breeches rarely
falling below the knee; the feet are shod with
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ojotas</i>, or rawhide sandals, which take the shape
of the foot. The woman wears a small woollen
vest, cut low on the bosom; the skirt is the same
as that worn by the Aymara women; and on a
feast-day the Quechua woman wears all the petticoats
she possesses, one over another. As they are
all of equal length, each shows the edge of that
below it, whence a gamut of various colours.
The Quechua women are distinguished from the
Aymaras chiefly by their hats, which are flatter.</p>

<p>"The Quechua idiom is extremely rich and has
been studied grammatically.</p>

<p>"The Indian race has never been assimilated;
as it was at the moment of conquest, so it is
now; with the same language, the same customs,
and the same miserable dwellings, hardly fit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
shelter beasts. Isolated and solitary, or gathered
into hamlets of a few cabins, they are merely
conical huts of unbaked bricks, covered with
thatch or reeds, and consisting of one small
chamber, in which all the members of the family
live in the completest promiscuity. These huts, in
which the most wretched poverty and uncleanliness
reign supreme, contain nothing that we should call
furniture; as a rule there is no bed but the
hardened soil or a few coverings of ragged
sheepskin."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>The principal vice of the Indian is drink, both
with men and women. Perhaps it drowns reflection&mdash;race-sorrow.
But, as in the case of the
Mexicans and all others of the brown race, this
excess is not the fault alone of the drinker. The
producing of alcohol is, in many cases, a lucrative
trade for those above him, the large growers of
cane or other alcohol-yielding plants. Legislation,
moreover, against the evil, if it be necessary in
other lands&mdash;for example, the United States or
Britain&mdash;is surely necessary with the ignorant
Indian.</p>

<p>The Indian is, as has been said, melancholy.
He rarely laughs, except when he is drunk.
Perhaps this is partly due to the melancholy environment
of the Cordillera; perhaps the result
of his practical enslavement and the downfall of
his race.</p>

<p>Melancholy and music are here akin. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Indians of Peru and Bolivia have always been
lovers of their national music&mdash;veritably the music
of the Andes. They have many curious musical
instruments, many weird songs and musical
laments. Reed flutes or pipes and a species of
guitar are among the principal of these instruments.
The Bolivian Indian has a good ear for music,
and, it is said, will execute any piece of classical
music with precision. The military bands of Bolivia
are mostly composed of Indians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Bolivian Indian is also remarkable for
his ability to execute long passages on wind instruments.
Even while dancing he can blow the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quena</i> or the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">zampona</i>, which shows the vigour
of his lungs, a quality due to the altitudes in which
he lives. Few inhabitants of ordinary altitudes
could endure such a test.</p>

<p>"Native music is usually soft, plaintive and
naïve; its tremulous notes, often repeated five or
six times in a minor key, swell and die in a monotonous
rhythm which, to European ears, becomes
tedious. Never do the instruments or the songs
of the Indian suggest an idea of gaiety, but
always a profound melancholy, the idea of extreme
unhappiness and the wretchedness of a disordered
mind.</p>

<p>"However, for one reason or another the
Indians are now rather improving their music; and
in many parts one notes unmistakable efforts to
imitate and adapt the foreign conceptions of music
and to mingle them with their favourite native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
airs. The latter do not lose their melancholy,
but are even more affecting.</p>

<p>"Despite these improvements, which are not
general, the traveller is always greatly impressed
when, as he journeys through the mountainous
regions, surrounded on every hand by gloomy
masses without horizon, he hears, suddenly, at the
fall of night, rising near at hand in the midst of
a profound silence, the long mournful notes of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quena</i>, like a long and profound complaint,
which echo repeats in distant sobs. Sometimes
the flute is accompanied by the measured taps of
a drum or tambourine, and sometimes it accompanies
a song, monotonous and guttural as the
songs of the Arabs; sounds inspiring sombre
thoughts and provoking a shudder of melancholy
in the stranger who hears them for the first time.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quena</i>, indeed, produces sounds of a sinister
melancholy; one manner of playing it consists of
introducing it into a great crock of earthenware
pierced with a hole on either side so that the
hands may be introduced; and when so played it
yields notes of sepulchral sonority. In all the
arsenal of human music it would perhaps be impossible
to discover more doleful sounds.</p>

<p>"When this primitive music seeks to interpret
a comparatively calm and cheerful frame of mind
it is certainly a little more inspiriting, but some
of its notes are still like the moans of a stricken
soul.</p>

<p>"The native dances are for the most part
common to both Aymaras and Quechuas. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
most ridiculous and grotesque of these, on account
of the extravagant costumes worn by the dancers,
are the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Danzantes</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Huacas-Tocoris</i>, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pacoches</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Morenos</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tundiques</i> and others
yet, such as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sicuris</i> and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Chiriguano</i>.</p>

<p>"This last is a war-dance; the dancers wear
each the skin of a jaguar, or something resembling
one; each carries a heavy stick; the music is
harsh and warlike. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sicuri</i> is danced by a
group of fourteen Indians, wearing petticoats of
white cotton cloth; on the head of each is a hat
adorned with long feathers, the whole having the
shape of an umbrella; they wear tambourines at
their girdles and play the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">zampona</i>, using two instruments.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">huaca-tocoris</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toros danzantes</i>
is performed during the fêtes of Corpus. A
wooden framework covered with hide vaguely
represents a bull; in the back of the beast is a
hole through which the dancer introduces his
body; his face smeared with soot, and clad in
the following costume: white breeches, an old coat,
a red poncho, and a hat bearing a semicircular
crown of feathers. To imitate a bull-fighter
another dancer brandishes a wooden sword in one
hand and waves a handkerchief with the other.</p>

<p>"The commonest dance among the Indians is
a slow, almost automatic <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rondo</i>, the head continually
rising and falling and turning from side
to side. In another dance the dancers form
couples, keeping their ground, and facing one
another, accelerating their steps only at the end of
each figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"During Lent the majority of the natives do
not employ any instrumental music, but, on the
other hand, they attend nocturnal gatherings known
as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chochus</i>, at which young people of both sexes
dance round a cross and sing psalms. There is
absolutely nothing edifying about these functions,
those taking part in them displaying a most disconcerting
cynicism. On Easter Day the Indians
wear their gala costumes, and ornament their hats
with flowers and ribbons; they make up for their
forty days' silence, and fill the air with the sound
of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quenas</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sicus</i> and tambourines. But even while
dancing they are never gay; their sombre natures
unbend only under the influence of drink.</p>

<p>"Among the strange and savage customs of
the natives, we must not forget to mention the
fights with whips which take place in certain provinces
on Good Friday. On the occasion of the
procession of the Sepulchre the Indians build altars
along the route of the procession. The latter takes
place always at night. Once it is over the
altars are demolished by two separate groups&mdash;the
Huarcas and the Incas, who at once begin to strive
for victory. The two groups then assemble in
the public place or square, and lash one another
with implacable ardour. Triumph or failure is a
good or bad omen for the year's harvest.</p>

<p>"Poetical songs, accompanied on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quechua</i>,
are known as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yaravis</i>. They are greatly appreciated
by the natives. The Quechua <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yaravis</i> have been
to some extent improved by the modern Bolivians.
They are usually a species of round, with a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
deal of repetition; each stanza has four to ten
lines. These songs reflect the dreamy and sombre
character of the race. Love is always their subject;
a melancholy, plaintive and monotonous
passion.</p>

<p>"The Bolivian Indian usually provides for his
modest needs in his own way; ignorant of the
advantages of the division of labour, he weaves
the cloth of his own garments&mdash;mantle, breeches,
or vest&mdash;and makes his hat and sandals himself.
His chief occupations are agriculture and stockraising;
but he is indolent, thriftless, imprudent
and, above all, an obstinate conservative; so he
confines himself to growing a few potatoes, a little
barley, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quinua</i>, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">oca</i>, just as much as he needs
to keep him alive. The land, cultivated by the
most primitive of means&mdash;for the Indian will never
accept any innovation, however practical and excellent&mdash;is
generally very limited in extent, unless
the neighbourhood of a city of a mine calls for
a greater production than usual. Moreover, thousands
of Indians are taken away from' their fields
by all manner of tasks&mdash;by the necessity of
transporting merchandise, provisions, machinery,
etc., on the backs of mules, asses, llamas and
even men, in countries innocent of other means of
transport, to the mines and factories established
in barren and uncultivated regions.</p>

<p>"Both the Aymaras and the Quechuas keep
little herds of llamas, alpacas or sheep whenever
possible, as their care calls; for less labour than
the raising of crops. A few fowls and other birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
give them eggs, a few pigs furnish leather, meat
and fat; they have the wool of their llamas and
sheep, and they utilize even the excrement of the
former as a combustible, as the Tibetans do that
of the yak. A mule or a donkey grazes round
the Indian's hut. From the age of four or five
years the Indian guards the little herd of swine
belonging to his parents; a little later he grazes
their sheep among the mountains, where by means
of his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quena</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">zampona</i> or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cicus</i> he learns to play
melancholy airs.</p>

<p>"On the produce of his crops and his herds he
lives in poverty, leaving the mountains or the plain
only to exchange some of his products for coca
or brandy. The woman is rarely idle; whether in
the market, or loitering over her household tasks,
or even as she walks, one sees her always spinning
the wool of the llama or the sheep of which her
garments are made.</p>

<p>"The Bolivian Indian in general excels in carrying
loads, in spite of the lack of tolerable highways,
covering daily stages of twenty to thirty
miles. The average load is 66 to 80 lb. With
his shoulders free his speed and endurance are
amazing; he will cover fifty miles a day for
several days on end, and without feeling exhausted,
unless for some reason he wishes to seem
so. We have seen Indians follow or accompany
the coach or the mule which bore us, at the trot,
shouting or blowing a pan-pipe; and at night
they seemed less eager to rest than our mules or
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Indian is to-day little better off than he
was under Spanish rule. Since the proclamation
of Bolivar, which declared him capable of holding
property, many Governments have passed laws intended
to protect the Indian; but they have either
remained ineffective or they have been overlooked
and violated by the very officials whose duty it was
to apply them."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Cholo, or half-breed, race of the Cordillera&mdash;or
indeed the lowlands&mdash;is, after the Indian,
the most numerous element in the population.
These folk unite the qualities of the Spaniard and
the aboriginal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Cholos of Bolivia possess excellent qualities.
They are robust and well-built physically;
they are courteous and intelligent, rapidly acquiring
all sorts of knowledge; they are, as a rule, proud
and courageous, and, like the Indians, make excellent
soldiers. They are good industrial
workers; many become foremen and artisans.
But they are also, like the Indian race from which
they have sprung, avid of pleasure, with a strong
inclination to idleness and alcohol. They profoundly
despise the Indians, whose worst enemies
they are; and they have always retained the
Indian's timidity or servility toward the white
man. Like the Indians, they are often lacking in
energy, will-power and commercial or agricultural
initiative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Cholos, except in the poor and backward
classes of society, are in no wise distinguishable,
as to costume, from the white inhabitants. The
women, or Cholas, many of whom are extremely
pretty, are generally well made, with small hands
and feet; their costume is conspicuous and characteristic.
The Cholas of the more well-to-do
classes are always extremely well shod, wearing
high-laced boots with high heels, made of leather
soft as a glove and of a light shade. These boots
show off the foot and a shapely leg, clad in well-fitting
stockings. The head is protected by a round
hat of whitish felt, two black tresses falling down
the back. On the shoulders they wear light shawls,
white or of some other bright colour, of silk or
other material, which covers a low-cut bodice worn
over a short white pleated skirt, beneath which
is a white petticoat edged with lace, which is
slightly longer than the skirt. As the skirt is
gathered on the hips, which are thus enlarged, and
the bottom of the skirt is weighted, it sways as
the wearer walks like the skirt of a dancer. The
whole costume has a rather pleasing effect.</p>

<p>"The Cholas of the lower classes wear the same
hat, the same coiffure, and a skirt of heavy woollen
stuff, gathered on the hips, but no laced petticoat.
The legs are bare and the feet are shod with
sandals or cheap shoes.</p>

<p>"Hygiene is not always respected by the half-breeds
of the lower classes, who are very superstitious.
They bathe, it seems, only on odd dates,
and more particularly on the 9th, 17th or 21st,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
otherwise they would be ill the rest of the year;
and one must never take more than twenty-one
baths in the year, or the same results would follow.</p>

<p>"The Cholos are in the minority in the country
districts, but live, as a rule, in the towns and
cantons. Since they have participated directly and
ardently in politics, they profess to live, if not for,
at least by the State, and have a perfect passion
for bureaucracy. In the towns and capitals the
Cholos more especially enter the Army and the
Church, and lately have also become schoolmasters.
There are very distinguished men among the half-breeds,
whose degree of education varies. At all
times this class has furnished really remarkable
statesmen and writers of talent.</p>

<p>"On account of the many crossings which have
taken place, and are still taking place, it is not
always possible, without great perspicacity, to distinguish
a member of the white race from one of
the superior classes of half-breeds. All Bolivians
are very much alike physically, and the singular
yellowish tint to be observed in the cornea of the
mixed race, a noticeable and tenacious characteristic
of the Indian, and one that often persists
to the third and fourth generation, at last entirely
disappears. The colour of the skin is not a certain
indication, for it depends upon the local
conditions.</p>

<p>"We are of opinion, and many agree with us,
that the future of the half-breed race is henceforth
assured; that in years to come, when it is
still further improved by the admixture of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
blood, it will play a very prominent and active
part in the national life. Already the half-breeds,
who are more numerous than the whites, and
almost as numerous as the Indians, are beginning
to accumulate capital and to fill important posts
in commercial houses. A half-breed aristocracy
is in process of formation, which, when it is more
numerous and more wealthy, when it has lost a
little of its indolence and timidity, and has acquired
greater initiative and a more serious education, will
no longer be content to take a secondary place.
Little by little&mdash;and examples already exist&mdash;it will
assume the direction of the great industrial and
commercial undertakings, and we shall see it consolidating
its numerical and financial superiority
by assuming the political direction of the country,
to the detriment of the whites."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I have dwelt thus lengthily upon the Indian
races of the Cordillera for the reason that they have
been comparatively little studied, and are indeed
almost unknown to the outside world in general.
They are in reality a valuable folk, mainly
because they alone can perform sustained labour
in the Cordillera, due to the condition of climate
and atmosphere. If they disappear&mdash;and they do
not appear to be increasing&mdash;these vast uplands
might become uninhabited wildernesses. They are
not likely to increase until the economic condition
of their lives is improved, and, as a consequence,
the heavy mortality among infants arrested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>To suppose that the Indians of the Cordillera
are incapable, or even will be incapable, of receiving
a higher civilization is to fall into a
sociological error. The governing classes of these
republics often assert this, however. But it will
depend very much how "civilization" is applied
to them. They are capable of becoming good
mechanics and craftsmen, they are extremely careful
and painstaking, as the intricacy and exquisite
finish often of their native arts show; they imitate
perhaps better than they initiate, but they nevertheless
display considerable resource. They will not
be herded into factories, if civilization consists
in that. They are independent, and prefer to work
for themselves.</p>

<p>As to their numbers, if we take the combined
population of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Bolivia at, say, twelve to thirteen million people,
and deduct ten to twenty per cent. for the whites
and mestizos, we shall obtain approximately the
number of these real sons and daughters of the
soil to-day, mainly upon the Cordillera.</p>

<p>The Cordillera of the Andes is, we might fancifully
say, the great banker of the West, the great
guardian of gold and sliver, the father of minerals,
and the progenitor of the treasure of the rocks.
We have seen that Peru is a land fabulous for its
mineral wealth; Colombia, far to the north, has
only lesser stores of metals, precious or base;
Ecuador has been but little favoured in this respect,
but nevertheless has a famed old gold mine; Chile
is markedly rich in almost every mineral. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Bolivia perhaps surpasses all these. There was a
famous Peruvian scientist and traveller, of Italian
extraction&mdash;Raimondi&mdash;who described the plateau
of Bolivia as "a table of silver supported by a
column of gold." The same might be said of
Peru. In the Cordillera generally we find gold
in the lower districts, silver in the higher. It
would almost seem that the metals have some
affinity with the climate. At least the native Peruvian
miner says that "the gold looks for the
warmth, the silver for the cold."</p>

<p>Thus in the cold and the bleakness of the high
hills do we find the white metal in Bolivia: we
find, indeed, two white metals verging upon the
regions of perpetual snow&mdash;silver and tin.</p>

<p>The tin mines, indeed, were first worked for
silver, and the tin ores thrown away.</p>

<p>For the lore of silver-mining let us ascend to
Potosi, the Silver Mountain. Its summit rises in
perfect sugar-loaf form to over 16,000 feet above
the level of the sea. Upon the slopes of this
wonderful mountain, some 2,000 or 3,000 feet
lower down, stands a city, founded in 1545
by the adventurous Spaniards, with their keen
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olfato</i>, or instinct for gold and silver, and fifty
years later 150,000 folk had their habitations
there. For lodes and seams of the richest silver
ore lay here&mdash;native silver and others; and the
shell of the mountain quickly became honeycombed
with shafts and galleries. Of five thousand such,
a thousand may be seen to-day.</p>

<p>All classes of adventurers flocked to Potosi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
There were bankrupt Spanish nobles, thinking by
a lucky stroke, or with their name and prestige,
to recoup themselves; there were merchants,
anxious to obtain sudden wealth; gamblers,
thieves, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</i> and all else, and Potosi
became a centre of prodigality, romantic adventure,
revelry and often disorder. Here Spanish
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hidalgos</i> vied with each other in squandering fortunes
in pleasure and ostentation, matters which
caused faction-strife among the bands into which
the people of the place were divided. The old
chronicles of Potosi are very interesting, revealing
as they do the custom of those times, the
superstition, the chivalry and all else, which not
even the high and solemn environment of the Cordillera
could dampen.</p>

<p>To-day an English mining company works upon
the mountain, striving to earn dividends for its
shareholders. The silver is far from being exhausted,
but methods of recovery fell back; and
the low value of silver and the high rate of wage
demanded by the miner were other factors in
decadence.</p>

<p>The Potosi mountain was not a possession of
the Spaniard alone. It has a metallurgical interest
more remote. A traveller in the Cordillera
before the time of the Conquest might have seen,
as he approached the spot at night, a number of
twinkling lights upon the slopes. They were the
fires of the little furnaces in which the Indians, of
the Incas, smelted the simpler silver ores, the winds
of the Cordillera furnishing the needful blast; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
these furnaces were called in Quechua Guayras,
which word means "the wind." It is said that at
one time more than 15,000 of these little furnaces
were to be seen upon the Silver Mountain, which
reared its desolate slopes to heaven, but was a
treasure-house of Nature.</p>

<p>It would not be possible here to dwell on the
other great mines of Bolivia.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The mines of
Huanchaca, with their great installation and considerable
population, form a community of themselves,
and have produced literally thousands of
tons of silver. In winter, buried in snow, the
place looks like a town of Northern Europe or
Canada. The ores are first sorted by women, who
are expert sorters of the grey argentiferous copper
ores of the main lode. At times of late years
nearly half a million pounds sterling have been
distributed among the European shareholders of
this important concern. Sometimes in a single
month as much as seven tons of silver have been
produced.</p>

<p>Silver to-day is less important than tin, however,
which has become the principal article of
Bolivian export, wrested from the bleakest places
here in the Andes, as is the copper of Chile.</p>

<p>We have visited, in the Cordillera of South
America, the highest inhabited places on the face
of the globe.</p>

<p>But south of Bolivia the Andes no longer offers
a place for the homes of mankind, for towns
and populations, such as Nature has provided in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
those vast regions we have traversed. The Cordillera
becomes a single chain or ridge, without
intermediate valleys or plateaux, and so continues
for an enormous distance, lowering its elevation
by degrees towards the frigid regions of the
southern extremity of the continent, where its
glaciers veritably run down into the bosom of the
ocean. Perhaps the Cordillera has sunk here, as
its "drowned" valleys&mdash;the fiords of the south
seem to indicate&mdash;sunk, split and shattered as if
Nature had done enough in this vast range running
half across the globe.</p>

<p>If, however, the Chilean Cordillera does not
offer an abiding place for man, it nevertheless
is the source of his comfort and wealth, for the
streams which flow from its summits irrigate the
fields and vineyards of Chile's fruitful vales and
Argentina's productive plains, bringing to being
corn, wine and oil, and other things which make
glad the heart of man.</p>

<p>The Andes form the dividing-line between Chile
and Argentina. The water-parting was adopted
as the boundary under the arbitration of King
Edward of Britain. A remarkable monument has
been erected in Uspallata Pass, a token that these
two nations will enter into conflict no more; a
great bronze statue of Christ, on a huge pedestal&mdash;El
Cristo de los Andes&mdash;standing solitary and
majestic amid the eternal snows, looking out over
the high places of the mighty Cordillera.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The good Church of England, in caring for her sons in
Spanish America, is perforce obliged to have regard to the vast
distances she must cover here. Thus the Bishop of the Falkland
Islands' flock&mdash;his diocese&mdash;extends over the not inconsiderable
territory covering the west coast of South America,
including Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and so forth&mdash;a strip
some five or six thousand miles long. As I formed one of a
committee with the good bishop to endeavour to raise funds
among English business men to carry on his work (and incidentally
to lecture on the subject), I had the matter brought
specially to my notice. Again, the Bishop of Honduras, in
a recent letter to <cite>The Times</cite>, appealed for funds for a vessel,
by means of which he might visit his flock over the vast diocese
that included Honduras and British Honduras, Costa Rica,
Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama.
</p>
<p>
And again, in giving evidence before the Select Committee
of the House of Commons to inquire into the Putumayo rubber
scandals, which I was called upon as a witness to do, concerning
the Indians of Peru, it was necessary to inform the gentlemen
of the Commission that the easiest way of reaching Eastern
from Western Peru was to take steamer up the Pacific coast,
cross the Isthmus of Panama, go home across the Atlantic to
Liverpool, and come back again to the Amazon and go up that
river!</p></div>
